# Quick Start - Bot Analysis Execution

**Status**: 🟢 Ready to Execute (Option A Selected)
**Time Required**: 5-10 minutes setup + 5 minutes execution

---

## 🚀 Option A: Automated Execution (You Selected This)

### Step 1: Run Setup Wizard

```bash
cd "/Users/hancezhang/Claude code exp/product_op"
./setup_and_run.sh
```

The wizard will ask you for:
- Database host (e.g., `localhost` or `db.myshell.ai`)
- Database port (default: `3306`)
- Database username
- Database password (hidden input)
- Database name (default: `tg2app`)

### Step 2: Wait for Results

The script will:
1. ✅ Save credentials to `.env` file
2. ✅ Test database connection
3. ✅ Execute 4 priority SQL queries
4. ✅ Save results to `analysis_results_*/` directory
5. ✅ Generate API query script

### Step 3: Review Results

I'll automatically analyze the results and provide:
- Power User Analysis (most critical)
- Message Distribution
- Engagement Patterns
- Strategic Recommendations

---

## 🔒 Security Note

Your database credentials will be saved to `.env` file locally. This file is:
- ✅ Not committed to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Only readable by you (chmod 600)
- ✅ Can be deleted after analysis

---

## ⚡ Alternative: Manual Credentials

If you prefer not to use the wizard, you can manually create `.env`:

```bash
cd "/Users/hancezhang/Claude code exp/product_op"

# Create .env file
cat > .env << 'EOF'
DB_HOST=your_host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your_user
DB_PASS=your_password
DB_NAME=tg2app
EOF

# Run analysis
./execute_analysis.sh
```

---

## ❓ Don't Have Database Access?

### Option B: Run Queries Manually

If you can't provide credentials but have database access through a GUI tool:

1. Open the SQL files in `analysis_results_20251027_204700/`:
   - `q1_2_power_users.sql` ⭐ (MOST IMPORTANT)
   - `q4_2_user_stats.sql`
   - `q7_1_high_engagement.sql`

2. Execute in your database tool (DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, etc.)

3. Export results to CSV

4. Share the CSV files with me (or paste results)

### Option C: Alternative Data Source

If you have access to the API but not the database:

Tell me and I can try a different approach using the API endpoints in `query.md`.

## 🎯 What Happens After Execution?

### Immediate (5 minutes)

I'll analyze the SQL results and tell you:

**Question 1**: What % of users are Power Users?
- Answer determines entire product strategy
- <10% = Each bot is separate
- 10-30% = Some crossover, optimize discovery
- >30% = Hook_Generator is a gateway

**Question 2**: Is myshell's high engagement evenly distributed?
- Answer determines scaling strategy
- Even = Scale broadly
- Power law = Target specific users

**Question 3**: What's the typical usage span?
- Identifies retention patterns
- Determines if bots are utilities vs workflows

### Deep Analysis (30 minutes)

- User journey mapping
- Churn analysis by bot type
- Remix behavior patterns
- Engagement cohort segmentation

### Final Report (1 hour)

- Product roadmap priorities
- GTM strategy updates
- Bot portfolio optimization
- Specific recommendations for each bot

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: mysql"

The script requires MySQL client. Options:

**Install MySQL Client**:
```bash
# macOS
brew install mysql-client

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
```

**Or use Python instead**:
I can modify the script to use Python with pymysql if you prefer.

### "Access denied for user"

Check your credentials:
```bash
cat .env  # Review credentials
rm .env   # Delete and re-run setup wizard
```

### "Can't connect to MySQL server"

Check:
- Is the database host reachable? `ping $DB_HOST`
- Is the port correct? (Usually 3306)
- Are you on VPN if required?
- Firewall blocking connection?

## 📊 Expected Output

After successful execution, you'll see:

```
analysis_results_TIMESTAMP/
├── q1_1_all_users.csv          # ~106 rows (user IDs)
├── q1_2_power_users.csv        # ~10-50 rows (multi-bot users)
├── q4_2_user_stats.csv         # ~106+ rows (per-user stats)
├── q7_1_high_engagement.csv    # ~5-20 rows (top users)
└── execute_api_queries.sh      # Ready for next phase
```

I'll read these files and generate comprehensive insights.

## 🎬 Ready to Start?

Run this command now:

```bash
cd "/Users/hancezhang/Claude code exp/product_op"
./setup_and_run.sh
```

Or if you need help, tell me:
- "I don't have database access" → I'll guide you to Option B/C
- "I need to modify the queries first" → I'll help you customize
- "Something's not working" → Tell me the error message

**I'm ready to analyze as soon as the queries execute!** 🚀
