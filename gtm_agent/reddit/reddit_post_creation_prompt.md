## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Native Reddit Writing Style (Updated 2025-10-24)

**BEFORE writing any post, MUST read and apply**: `reddit_native_style_guide.md`

**Core Principle**: 不完美才是真实 (Imperfection is authenticity)

**Top 5 Non-Negotiable Rules**:
1. ❌ **NEVER use em dash (—)** - instant AI detection
2. ❌ **NEVER use - for bullet points** - use · instead
3. ✅ **Shill comments MUST be 2-4 paragraphs** (not 1 sentence)
4. ✅ **OP replies MUST include bot names** (e.g., @ShellAgent_CaptionBot)
5. ✅ **Post angles MUST be diverse** (not all experience-sharing)

**Post Angle Distribution for 20 Posts**:
- Open Discussion: 30% (6 posts)
- Observation/Discovery: 25% (5 posts)
- Experiment/Test: 20% (4 posts)
- Help/Confusion: 15% (3 posts)
- Comparison/Analysis: 10% (2 posts)

---

## Mission

Create high-performing Reddit posts that:
1. Feel authentic and community-native (not promotional)
2. Drive genuine engagement and discussion
3. Convert readers into ShellAgent users
4. Survive moderation and community scrutiny (no removals)

**Core Constraint**: Users come to Reddit to discuss, find resonance, learn from others, and be entertained—NOT to see ads. Successful posts must align with one or more of these motivations.

---

## User Psychology Framework

Successful Reddit content triggers at least ONE of these psychological drivers:

### 1. Expression Desire (表达欲)
- Open-ended questions everyone can answer
- Controversial or counter-intuitive statements (triggers反驳欲)
- Relatable experiences that invite sharing

### 2. Curiosity (好奇心)
- Claims of achieving seemingly impossible results
- "Secret" knowledge or insider insights
- Fast/surprising outcomes

### 3. Information Gain (获得感)
- Actionable guides and methodologies
- Curated tool lists and resources
- Structured frameworks

### 4. Resonance (共鸣)
- Shared pain points and frustrations
- "Is anyone else..." vulnerability
- Specific, detailed personal struggles

---

## Post Strategy Matrix

### Strategy A: Direct Link in Main Post (主帖直接挂链)

**A1: Developer/Builder Sharing**
- **Format**: Share project from developer perspective, invite feedback
- **Example titles**:
  - "Built a Telegram Bot that Helps You Create Other Bots (No Code Needed!)"
  - "Built a no-code Telegram bot builder tool. Looking for early testers!"
- **Constraints**: ONLY for highly targeted communities or developer/entrepreneur subreddits
- **Risk**: High (direct promotion)

**A2: Mutual Sharing Invitation**
- **Format**: Share your project first, then invite others to share theirs
- **Example titles**: "What are you building in 2025? Drop your project!"
- **Constraints**: Best for developer/entrepreneur communities
- **Risk**: Medium

**A3: Tool List Embedding**
- **Format**: Curated list with product embedded among other tools
- **Example titles**:
  - "10 AI productivity tools I use that ACTUALLY deliver results"
  - "Creator list of tools (Bot version)"
- **Constraints**:
  - Too many links → triggers spam filters
  - Too many tools → dilutes attention
  - Must plant shill comments early or competitors will dominate comments
- **Risk**: Medium-High (spam filters)

**A4: Success Story / Methodology Share**
- **Format**: Share experience/learnings from first-person perspective, provide value
- **Example titles**: "How I Cut My Content Creation Workflow from 2 Hours to 30 Minutes with Telegram Bots"
- **Opportunity**: High potential if genuinely valuable long-form content
- **Risk**: Low if content is high-quality

---

### Strategy B: Link in Comments (评论区挂链)

**B1: Story Hook → Shill Question → OP Link** ✅ VALIDATED
- **Main post**: Share story with curiosity hook, NO link
- **Shill comment**: "How did you do that?"
- **OP reply**: Answer with link
- **Example title**: "I built my own checklist bot in 5 min and now I can't live without it."
- **Risk**: Low

**B2: Open Question → Shill Experience → OP Follow-up** ✅ VALIDATED
- **Main post**: Ask open-ended question
- **Shill comment**: Share impressive experience WITHOUT link
- **OP reply**: "That's amazing, how did you do it?"
- **Shill 2nd reply**: Drop link
- **Example title**: "What AI Agents have genuinely changed the way you work?"
- **Risk**: Low

**B3: Specific Question → Shill Answer with Link** ❌ LESS EFFECTIVE
- **Main post**: Ask targeted question about specific use case
- **Shill comment**: Answer with link
- **Example titles**:
  - "How do you track and analyze competitor accounts for content ideas?"
  - "Has anyone tried using AI for making thumbnails?"
- **Issue**: Narrow questions limit engagement (fewer people have relevant experience)

---

"It's a Telegram based mini app that lets you build telegram bots just by typing out what you want it to do."

[Emotional Reaction]
Express genuine surprise, satisfaction, or other emotions.
"I don't have a tech background, so it felt weirdly satisfying to get something working that fast."

[Open Question - FOCUS ON EXPERIENCE SHARING]
Not tool recommendations; ask about their experiences.
"What kind of things did you make? What worked or didn't work for you?"
```

**Example**: https://www.reddit.com/r/nocode/comments/1nhnd38/tried_a_nocode_telegram_bot_builder_and_was_kinda/

---

### Template 4: Personal Project Share (模版4)
**Purpose**: Share your creation or usage, demonstrate real value

**Logic**: I made/used/discovered something → It solved my real problem → I'm sharing because it might help you too

**Structure Formula**: Personal Motivation + Product Intro + Results & Feelings + Discussion Invite

```
[Personal Motivation]
Why you built/used this.
"I built … because I was tired of …"
"I've been trying to track my spending but could never stick with any budgeting apps."

## Language & Style Requirements

### Core Principles
1. **Imperfection**: Humans are imperfect; AI is perfect. Use colloquialisms, informal grammar, natural imperfections.
2. **Specificity & Detail**: Describe concrete scenarios with rich details. Readers should be able to imagine exactly who you are (identity, nationality, profession).
3. **Emotion**: Real humans have emotions. Balance appropriately:
   - **Shill comments**: Light recommendation emotions ("kinda exciting", "makes sense")
   - **OP replies**: Strong interest emotions ("Damn that's cool!", "I really wanna pick your brain")

---

### Red Flags to AVOID (AI Detection Signals)

❌ **Em dashes (—)**: Instant AI tell for native English speakers
❌ **Excessive parentheses and quotes**: Feels too formal/written
❌ **Perfect structure**: Avoid rigid 总分总 patterns
❌ **Overly strong recommendations**: "I'd definitely recommend" sounds promotional
❌ **Words like "especially," "particularly"**: Too formal for casual Reddit comments
❌ **No colloquialisms**: Real users say "kinda," "gonna," "wanna," "tbh," "imo," "tldr"
❌ **No typos or corrections**: Occasional imperfection adds authenticity
❌ **Too polished**: Multiple-paragraph responses with perfect topic sentences

---

### Green Signals to INCLUDE (Human Authenticity Markers)

✅ **Colloquialisms**: "kinda," "a bit," "sorta," "tbh," "imo," "ngl"
✅ **Contractions**: "I've," "didn't," "can't," "it's"
✅ **Filler words**: "you know," "I mean," "like"
✅ **Casual punctuation**: Single line breaks, occasional emojis (:), "haha," "lol"
✅ **Slang**: "Damn," "Sick!," "dope," "legit"
✅ **Specific details**: Tools tried, exact use cases, time spent, concrete examples
✅ **Emotional reactions**: Surprise, frustration, satisfaction—but calibrated to role (OP vs. shill)
✅ **Varied sentence length**: Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones

---

## Writing Style Examples

### ❌ BAD: AI-Generated Feel

**Title**: "Tried a no-code tool that builds Telegram bots from plain text."

**Body**:
```
I've been playing around with no-code tools and "vibecoding" projects lately, and I stumbled across something kind of interesting — a Telegram-based tool that lets you build bots just by describing what you want in plain English. No dashboards, no drag-and-drop, it all happens directly inside Telegram.

It felt pretty different from the usual no-code tools I've tried, and surprisingly smooth. I tested it with a few small bot ideas (like reminders, or sending mockup images), and it actually worked way better than I expected.

Curious if anyone else has come across this kind of thing — Telegram-native no-code bot builders, or other lightweight tools that let you prototype ideas really fast without jumping between platforms. Would love to hear what you've tried and how it went.
```

**Issues**:
- Em dash (—) - instant AI tell
- Too perfect structure (总分总)
- Quotes around "vibecoding" - too formal
- Parenthetical examples - bookish
- "Would love to hear" - too polished

---

### ✅ GOOD: Human-Authentic Feel

**Title**: "Tried a no-code Telegram bot builder and was kinda surprised."

**Body**:
```
I've been into no code tools for a while and recently found something a bit different. It's a Telegram based mini app that lets you build telegram bots just by typing out what you want it to do. You know, everything happens right inside Telegram, I don't need to open a separate app.

I don't have a tech background, so it felt weirdly satisfying to get something working that fast without touching any code and totally within telegram. This one felt lighter and more direct than most no code stuff I've used before.

Just curious if anyone else here has built bots in Telegram without coding, or tried similar tools like this. What kind of things did you make? What worked or didn't work for you?
```

**Strengths**:
- "kinda surprised" - colloquial + emotional
- "a bit different" - casual qualifier
- "you know" - filler word (human!)
- Natural flow without rigid structure
- "weirdly satisfying" - specific emotion
- Open-ended question at end

---

## Shill Comment Examples

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Shill comments MUST be 2-4 paragraphs. One-sentence comments are obvious shills and will be flagged.

### ❌ BAD: Too Short (Obvious Shill)

```
This sounds super useful. Do you have a link?
```

**Issues**:
- Only 1 sentence
- Asks for link immediately
- No personal details
- No relatability

---

### ❌ BAD: Still Too Short

```
This sounds super useful. I always have random Telegram bot ideas but never end up building them. Do you have a link? Would love to try it out.
```

**Issue**: Still only 1 paragraph, asks for link immediately

---

### ⚠️ MEDIOCRE: Safe but Too Formal (2 paragraphs minimum met)

```
This really resonates. I've tried making a Telegram bot before using some YouTube tutorials and Python, but honestly it got overwhelming pretty fast. I mostly wanted to build simple stuff like a bot that logs my daily habits or sends scheduled messages to myself, but I always ended up dropping it halfway through.

The idea of building something directly inside Telegram without switching tools sounds really refreshing. Definitely curious to see how far that kind of setup can go.
```

**Issues**: Too formal, too structured, lacks personality, no specific personal details (channel size, time spent, etc.)

---

### ✅ GOOD: Authentic Interest (2-3 paragraphs with details)

```
ok this is actually pretty relevant to what i've been dealing with lately.

i run a small youtube channel (500 subs) and the biggest time sink for me is honestly just coming up with titles and thumbnails. i'll spend like 30 minutes staring at canva trying to figure out what looks good and then the video still flops lol.

tried using chatgpt for title ideas but it's kind of annoying having to copy paste everything. telegram bots sound like they'd fit better into my workflow since im already in telegram all day anyway.

curious how you set yours up. did you build them yourself or use something pre-made?
```

**Strengths**:
- 4 paragraphs (exceeds minimum)
- Specific personal details (500 subs, 30 minutes, canva, chatgpt)
- Lowercase starts ("ok", "i run")
- Colloquialisms ("lol", "kinda", "im already in telegram")
- Relatability (shares struggle)
- Natural question at end
- Does NOT ask for link directly

---

## OP Reply Examples

### ⚠️ DELETION RISK WARNING (Updated 2025-10-31)

**Based on real deletion cases from r/NewTubers and r/YouTubers, the following will get your post/comment REMOVED:**

❌ **Direct tool links in OP replies** (e.g., "check it out https://contentcreatortoolkit.carrd.co/")
❌ **Mentioning "built with shell agent/myshell"** in strict communities
❌ **@bot_name + detailed feature explanation** that looks like ad copy

**Community Risk Tiers:**

🔴 **High Risk** (r/NewTubers, r/YouTubers):
- Don't mention bot names
- Don't mention "shell agent" or "myshell"
- Guide to DMs: "happy to share more details if you dm me"

🟡 **Medium Risk** (r/ContentMarketing, r/GrowthHacking):
- Can mention bot names with @
- Don't mention "shell agent" or "myshell"
- No direct links

🟢 **Low Risk** (r/TelegramBots, r/AI_Agents):
- Full bot names with @ prefix OK
- Mentioning "shell agent" OK (but don't overdo)
- Natural tool discussion welcomed

---

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: OP replies format varies by community risk level. For low-risk communities, include bot names with @ prefix (e.g., @ShellAgent_CaptionBot, @YT_TitleBot). For high-risk communities, use generic terms and guide to DMs.

### ❌ BAD: Too Formal + No Bot Names + Em Dash

```
That sounds awesome — especially the Telegram one. Would love to see how you set that up or what it actually looks like in action. I've been wanting something similar but didn't know there were tools that make it that easy. Mind sharing a bit more?
```

**Issues**:
- Em dash (—) - instant AI tell
- "especially" - too formal
- Too structured/polite
- Weak emotional response
- NO BOT NAMES mentioned

---

### ⚠️ MEDIOCRE: Good tone but missing bot names

```
Damn that's really cool! Would you mind sharing a bit more? I really wanna pick your brain on this.
```

**Issues**: Good emotion but MISSING bot names (required!)

---

### ✅ GOOD: Enthusiastic + Bot Names + Specifics (NEW STANDARD)

```
oh nice! yeah so i built 3 main bots:

1. Caption Generator Bot (@ShellAgent_CaptionBot) - you give it a topic and it spits out like 5 caption options. saves me so much time vs staring at a blank doc
2. Thumbnail Gen Bot (@ShellAgent_ThumbGen) - similar thing but for thumbnails. gives you 5 variations and you pick the best
3. Content Repurposer (@ShellAgent_Repurpose) - this one's my favorite. upload a youtube video and it automatically turns it into 10 shorter posts for twitter/linkedin/instagram

built all of them using shell agent which is a no-code bot builder. took maybe an hour total to set up.

the caption bot alone saves me like 2 hours/week cause i used to agonize over every single caption lol.

happy to share more details if you wanna know the specific workflow or how i trained them on my brand voice.
```

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Bot names with @ prefix (@ShellAgent_CaptionBot, @ShellAgent_ThumbGen, @ShellAgent_Repurpose)
- Casual opener ("oh nice!")
- Specific numbers (2 hours/week, 1 hour to build)
- Colloquialisms ("lol", "kinda")
- Acknowledges limitations implicitly (need to "train on brand voice")
- Friendly close ("happy to share more details")
- Natural flow

---

### ✅ ALTERNATIVE: With Limitations Acknowledged

```
tbh it's not as complicated as it sounds. i'm not technical at all and i figured it out in like an afternoon.

i use shell agent (@ShellAgentBot on telegram) to build the bots. basically you just describe what you want in plain english and it generates the bot in like 10 minutes.

the three i use most are:
· title generator (@YT_TitleBot) - generates 10 youtube title variations
· shorts clipper (@ShortsClipBot) - takes a long video and clips it into 10 shorts automatically
· hook analyzer (@HookAnalyzer) - scores your video hooks 1-100

costs $25/month for unlimited bots. saves me like 10 hours/week so it's a no brainer for me.

they're not perfect tho. like i still edit 20-30% of the outputs cause some of them are generic. but it's way faster than starting from scratch.

if you end up trying it lmk how it goes. also happy to share my exact bot setup if that'd be helpful.
```

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Multiple bot names (@ShellAgentBot, @YT_TitleBot, @ShortsClipBot, @HookAnalyzer)
- Uses · for bullet points (not -)
- Acknowledges limitations ("not perfect", "still edit 20-30%")
- Specific pricing ($25/month, 10 hours/week saved)
- Colloquialisms ("tbh", "lmk", "lol")
- Friendly offer without pushing

---

### ✅ HIGH RISK COMMUNITY REPLY (r/NewTubers, r/YouTubers)

**Context**: When asked "how did you do that?" in strict communities

```
tbh i use some telegram automation for the repetitive stuff. saves me like 2 hours/week on titles and thumbnails.

it's not perfect tho, i still edit maybe 30% of what it generates. but way better than starting from scratch every time.

happy to share more specifics in dm if you're curious. don't wanna clog up the comments with tech stuff lol.
```

**Strengths**:
- ✅ No bot names (just "telegram automation")
- ✅ No mention of "shell agent" or "myshell"
- ✅ Specific time savings (2 hours/week)
- ✅ Acknowledges limitations (edit 30%)
- ✅ Guides to DMs naturally
- ✅ Colloquialisms ("tbh", "tho", "lol")
- ✅ Safe from deletion

**Why this works**:
- Doesn't trigger spam filters (no @mentions, no links)
- Shows value without being promotional
- Lets interested users reach out privately
- Keeps community clean (moderators appreciate this)

---

## Execution Constraints

### Publishing Cadence
- **Max 3 posts per subreddit per week** (space out by at least 1 day)
- Reason: Prevents brand/product detection by users and moderators
- Mix content types: 1 open discussion → 1 experience share → 1 project share

### Timing
- OP posts main thread
- Shill accounts WAIT 12-24 hours before commenting (more natural)

### Link Safety Rules
- **AVOID multiple links in one post**: High-risk spam signal
- **Comment links safer than main post links**: Lower removal risk, but less direct
- **High-karma accounts safer**: New accounts get flagged
- **Account hygiene**: Promotional posts should be <30% of total account history

### Link Posting Strategies When Blocked
Many subreddits block external links but trust YouTube:
1. Create YouTube video briefly explaining the tool
2. Put real link in video description
3. Post YouTube link on Reddit (passes filters)

### Per-Subreddit Rules Research
Before posting, ALWAYS check:
- Sidebar rules on self-promotion (look for 1:10 ratio or stricter)
- Moderator removal patterns (check recent deleted posts)
- Community tolerance (scan "new" for promotional content that survived)

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative (7-day window)
- **Survival**: Post not removed
- **Reach**: View count
- **Engagement**: Upvote count
- **Discussion**: Organic comment count (excluding shills)
- **Conversion**: New ShellAgent user signups

### Qualitative
- ✅ Sparked genuine discussion (real users replying to each other)
- ✅ Users expressing interest in product (asking for links, details, tutorials)
- ✅ Generated product iteration insights from user feedback
- ✅ Users DMing to discuss further
- ✅ Post reached subreddit's hot/top weekly/monthly/annual lists

---

## Post Creation Workflow

When user requests a Reddit post, follow this sequence:

1. **Confirm Inputs**:
   - Target subreddit
   - Product angle (Telegram bot builder vs. specific use case bot)
   - Strategy preference (A1-A4 or B1-B3)

2. **Research Context** (if not already done):
   - Check subreddit rules on self-promotion
   - Review recent top posts for format/tone benchmarks
   - Verify link policy

3. **Select Template**: Choose from Templates 1-4 based on strategy

4. **Draft Main Post**:
   - Title: Use title templates, ensure colloquial language
   - Body: Follow template structure
   - Language QA: Run through red flags/green signals checklist

5. **Draft Shill Comments** (if Strategy B):
   - 1st shill: Establish credibility with specific details
   - OP reply: Show strong genuine interest
   - 2nd shill (if needed): Drop link naturally

6. **Final Review**:

   **Main Post**:
   - [ ] No em dash (—)
   - [ ] Contains colloquialisms (idk, tbh, kinda, lol) - minimum 2
   - [ ] Lowercase starts - minimum 2
   - [ ] At least 1 imperfect grammar instance
   - [ ] Bullet points use · not - (if any bullets present)
   - [ ] No "especially", "particularly", "furthermore"
   - [ ] Structure is NOT perfect总分总
   - [ ] Has emotional expression (frustrated, honestly, weirdly)
   - [ ] Ends open and friendly (not selling, happy to share)
   - [ ] Matches one of 5 angle types (Discussion, Observation, Experiment, Help, Comparison)

   **Shill Comment**:
   - [ ] 2-4 paragraphs (NOT one sentence or one paragraph)
   - [ ] Includes specific personal details (numbers, tools, time)
   - [ ] Expresses relatability or skepticism
   - [ ] Does NOT directly ask for link
   - [ ] Ends with open question
   - [ ] Contains colloquialisms

   **OP Reply** (⚠️ CHECK COMMUNITY RISK TIER FIRST):

   **Step 0: Identify Community Risk Tier**:
   - [ ] 🔴 High Risk (r/NewTubers, r/YouTubers) - Use Tier 1 reply
   - [ ] 🟡 Medium Risk (r/ContentMarketing, r/GrowthHacking) - Use Tier 2 reply
   - [ ] 🟢 Low Risk (r/TelegramBots, r/AI_Agents) - Use Tier 3 reply

   **Universal Requirements (All Tiers)**:
   - [ ] No em dash
   - [ ] Specific numbers (time, cost, results)
   - [ ] Acknowledges limitations ("not perfect", "still edit 20%")
   - [ ] Friendly close ("lmk", "happy to share")
   - [ ] Contains colloquialisms

   **Tier-Specific Requirements**:

   🔴 **High Risk** - Strict Moderation:
   - [ ] NO bot names (use "telegram bot", "automation tool")
   - [ ] NO "shell agent" or "myshell" mentions
   - [ ] NO direct links
   - [ ] MUST guide to DMs ("happy to share in dm")

   🟡 **Medium Risk** - Moderate Moderation:
   - [ ] CAN include bot names (@BotName format)
   - [ ] NO "shell agent" or "myshell" mentions
   - [ ] NO direct links

   🟢 **Low Risk** - Permissive:
   - [ ] CAN include bot names (@BotName format)
   - [ ] CAN mention "shell agent" (but casually, not repeatedly)
   - [ ] Natural tool discussion OK

7. **Package Deliverable**:
   - Main post (title + body)
   - Shill comment(s) if applicable
   - Timing instructions
   - Expected metrics

---

## Output Format

When creating posts, structure output as:

```markdown

### Metrics to Track
- 7-day views
- Upvotes
- Organic comments
- Signups from post (use UTM: ?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=[subreddit_name])

### Risks
- [Any specific risks for this subreddit]
```

---

## Final Reminders

- **Never sacrifice authenticity for promotion**: If a post feels like an ad, rewrite until it doesn't
- **Community first, conversion second**: Genuine value attracts genuine users
- **Study each community**: What works in r/nocode might fail in r/productivity
- **Iterate based on feedback**: Track what works, double down on successful patterns
- **Respect moderators**: If removed, learn why and adjust; don't fight the system

**Core Truth**: The best Reddit marketing doesn't feel like marketing at all.
