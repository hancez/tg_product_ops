# Reddit Native Writing Style Guide
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Purpose**: 写出100%像真实Reddit用户的帖子、评论、回复

---

## 核心原则：不完美才是真实

Reddit用户不是专业作家。他们：
· 用小写字母开头
· 省略标点符号
· 打错字（偶尔）
· 使用大量colloquialisms
· 语法不完美
· 随性表达情绪

**Golden Rule**: 如果看起来太完美，就不像Reddit。

---

## 1. 帖子角度多样化（不只是经验分享）

### ❌ 目前问题：所有帖子都是"I did X, here's what happened"

### ✅ 多样化角度：

#### A. 开放式讨论帖（Discussion）
**格式**: 提出问题 → 简单背景 → 邀请讨论

**真实案例**（r/GrowthHacking）:
```
Title: What's something AI agents still can't do right now that you really wish they could?

Body:
I've been hunting and playing around with AI agents for a while now, and while the progress is impressive, I keep running into things that make me think: "Why can't it just do this already?"

What's one thing you wish agents could do today that they just can't (yet)?

Could be anything:
· Something you expected to be possible by now
· Something you think we're really close to
· Something that seems obvious but is surprisingly hard
· Or something totally futuristic and wild

Let's share our future wish-lists here and maybe a new innovation will meet our expectations. :D
```

**为什么有效**:
· 没有推销任何东西
· 邀请每个人参与
· 开放式问题
· 轻松友好的语气（":D"）

---

#### B. 观察/发现帖（Observation）
**格式**: 我注意到X → 细节 → 疑问

**真实案例**（r/NewTubers）:
```
Title: I wrote 20 hooks every day for a week. not sure what happened but something clicked.

Body:
idk if anyone else here's been stuck in that "why does no one watch my Shorts anymore" loop, but I got so frustrated last week that I literally forced myself to write 20 different hooks per day for 7 days straight.

day 1 was pure cringe ngl. half of them sounded like a robot trying to sell toothpaste.

but around day 3… I started noticing small stuff that weirdly worked:
1. verbs that feel emotional (like "imagine", "remember", "ever felt like…")
2. numbers that create pressure instead of info ("3 mistakes you don't notice until it's too late")
3. and not saying "you" too early. makes it sound less clickbait-y somehow

by day 7, I could almost tell within 2 seconds if something would flop or not. it's like my brain started predicting attention. idk how else to explain it lol

anyway, just wanted to drop this here in case someone's stuck in the same spot. not selling anything, just been testing a small framework that helped me a lot. happy to share it if anyone wants.
```

**风格特征**:
· 小写开头："idk", "but", "day 1"
· 非正式缩写："idk", "ngl", "lol"
· 不完美语法："weirdly worked"
· 具体天数："day 1", "day 3", "day 7"
· 自然结尾："happy to share it if anyone wants"

---

#### C. 求助/困惑帖（Help/Confusion）
**格式**: 我遇到X问题 → 已尝试Y → 求建议

**真实案例**（r/ContentMarketing）:
```
Title: Feeling stuck with generic outreach copy.

Body:
Lately, my cold outreach just feels flat. Even when I personalize intros, the body of my emails still sounds like everyone else's.

I'm trying to find ways to make my copy stand out without crossing into gimmicky territory. Humor doesn't always fit my audience, but straight-laced templates don't convert either.

What creative tactics are you using to keep outreach copy fresh in 2025?
```

**为什么有效**:
· 表达脆弱（"feeling stuck", "feels flat"）
· 承认困难（"can't figure out"）
· 邀请他人分享（"What are you using?"）

---

#### D. 对比/分析帖（Comparison）
**格式**: X vs Y → 我的观察 → 你怎么看

**真实案例**（r/ContentMarketing）:
```
Title: AI copy vs real marketing copy, big gap or just me?

Body:
I've been experimenting with how my team is using ChatGPT and other similar tools for content copy and scripts...

What I am seeing is that AI can give you something quickly, but it is not something that is actually converting.

[详细对比 Before/After]

The difference hit me.

I wonder how others are approaching this work-
· do you just edit everything to improve conversion?
· do you have a workflow...?
· how do you keep everything consistent...?

Would love to hear what other growth and/or creative teams are seeing...
```

**为什么有效**:
· Before/After对比清晰
· 承认不确定（"or just me?"）
· 开放式问题结尾
· 邀请对话（"would love to hear"）

---

#### E. 实验/测试帖（Experiment）
**格式**: 我测试了X → 数据 → 发现

**Shell Agent适用案例**:
```
Title: tested 3 different telegram bots for content workflow. one clear winner.

Body:
been managing content for 2 brands solo and was drowning in repetitive tasks.

decided to test automating some stuff with telegram bots since i basically live in telegram anyway.

tested 3 bots over the last month:
1. caption generator - input topic, get 5 caption variations
2. content repurposer - upload video, get posts for different platforms
3. trend monitor - scrapes reddit/twitter for trending topics

the content repurposer was the clear winner for me. saves like 8 hours/week.

caption generator was ok but outputs felt generic (had to edit 50% of them). trend monitor was useful but i could manually do that faster.

anyway just thought i'd share in case anyone else is in the same boat. not affiliated with any of these just documenting my test.

happy to answer questions if anyone's curious about specific workflows or how i set them up.
```

## 2. 语言风格：100%自然Reddit语言

### ❌ AI写作红旗（立即被识别）

1. **破折号 em dash (—)**: NEVER use
   · ❌ "I tested 3 bots — here's what worked"
   · ✅ "i tested 3 bots and here's what worked"

2. **过度使用括号**:
   · ❌ "I built bots (using Shell Agent) and saved time (15 hours/week)"
   · ✅ "built bots with shell agent, saved 15 hours/week"

3. **完美的总分总结构**:
   · ❌ Introduction → 3 body paragraphs → Conclusion
   · ✅ 随机思绪流，有时跳跃

4. **过度正式的词汇**:
   · ❌ "particularly", "especially", "specifically", "furthermore"
   · ✅ "tbh", "kinda", "sorta", "idk"

5. **AI常用短语**:
   · ❌ "I'd highly recommend"
   · ❌ "game-changer" (unless ironic)
   · ❌ "seamless workflow"
   · ❌ "deep dive"

---

### ✅ Reddit Native 语言特征

#### Colloquialisms（口语化表达）
· idk (I don't know)
· tbh (to be honest)
· ngl (not gonna lie)
· imo (in my opinion)
· lol, lmao, haha
· kinda, sorta, gonna, wanna
· like (filler word)
· you know (filler phrase)

#### 不完美语法
· 小写字母开头句子
· 省略主语："tested 3 bots" (不是 "I tested")
· Run-on sentences
· 句子碎片
· 偶尔拼写错误（不要刻意，但如果出现不修改）

#### 情绪表达
· damn, sick, dope, legit
· weirdly, randomly
· honestly, genuinely
· tbh, ngl（表达真诚）

#### 不确定性表达（显得谦虚）
· "not sure if this helps but..."
· "idk if anyone else..."
· "might just be me but..."
· "happy to be wrong but..."
· "could be totally off but..."

---

## 3. 帖子Body结构：非线性、随性

### ❌ 不要用的结构（太AI）
```
Introduction paragraph

Problem statement

Solution explanation with 3 bullet points

Results with metrics

Conclusion with call to action
```

### ✅ Reddit自然结构

#### 例子1：随性流（r/NewTubers style）
```
idk if anyone else here's been stuck in [pain point] but [personal trigger].

[quick action taken]

day 1 was [honest reaction]. [detail]

but around day 3... [turning point]

by day 7, [result]. [metaphor or explanation]

anyway, just wanted to drop this here in case someone's stuck in the same spot. not selling anything, just [what you're sharing].
```

#### 例子2：观察流（r/ContentMarketing style）
```
been doing [activity] for [timeframe] and noticed something interesting.

[observation 1] → [detail or example]

[observation 2] → [detail]

not sure if this is just me or if others are seeing the same thing.

curious what you all think. [open question]
```

---

## 4. Bullet Points: 用 · 不用 -

### ❌ Wrong
```
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3
```

### ✅ Correct
```
· Point 1
· Point 2
· Point 3
```

**Alternative**: 不用bullets，用数字或自然流
```
1. first thing i noticed was...
2. second thing...
3. third was kinda surprising actually...
```

---

## 5. 托儿评论（Shill Comments）：多段落、自然

### ❌ 目前问题：一句话评论（明显是托）
```
This sounds super useful. Do you have a link?
```

### ✅ 自然的长评论（2-4段落）

#### 模板1：关联+细节+轻度兴趣
```
ok this is actually pretty relevant to what i've been dealing with lately.

i run a small youtube channel (500 subs) and the biggest time sink for me is honestly just coming up with titles and thumbnails. i'll spend like 30 minutes staring at canva trying to figure out what looks good and then the video still flops lol.

tried using chatgpt for title ideas but it's kind of annoying having to copy paste everything. telegram bots sound like they'd fit better into my workflow since im already in telegram all day anyway.

curious how you set yours up. did you build them yourself or use something pre-made?
```

**特征**:
· 3段落
· 具体细节（"500 subs", "30 minutes", "canva"）
· 承认挣扎（"video still flops lol"）
· 不直接要链接
· 问开放式问题

---

#### 模板2：怀疑+共鸣+软化
```
ngl i'm usually pretty skeptical about automation stuff cause i've tried like 5 different tools that all claimed to "revolutionize my workflow" and they were all garbage lol.

but this actually sounds different. the telegram angle makes sense cause switching between 10 different apps is honestly my biggest productivity killer. if i could just stay in one place and have bots handle the repetitive stuff that'd be huge.

what kind of bots did you end up building? i'm assuming title generator and maybe thumbnail stuff based on your post but curious if there's other ones that were useful.
```

**特征**:
· 表达怀疑（建立可信度）
· 共鸣（"switching between apps"）
· 具体问题
· "ngl", "lol", "honestly"（口语化）

---

#### 模板3：经验分享+好奇
```
this is interesting timing cause i literally just had a breakdown last week about how much time i waste on content tasks.

i've been using notion for content planning and it's fine but it doesn't actually DO anything you know? like i still have to manually write every caption, design every thumbnail, come up with every title. feels like half my week disappears into this stuff.

i looked into zapier and make.com but they're so complicated. telegram bots sound way simpler if they actually work.

how long did it take you to set everything up? and do you need to know how to code or is it actually no-code like you mentioned?
```

**特征**:
· 分享自己经历（3-4句）
· 对比其他工具（Notion, Zapier）
· 多个问题（看起来genuinely curious）
· "you know?", "feels like", "if they actually work"（不确定性）

---

## 6. OP回复：自然、插入Bot名字 ⚠️ 推广红线

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: 推广红线 (基于真实删帖案例 2025-10-31)

**以下行为会导致帖子/评论被删除：**

❌ **在OP回复中直接贴工具链接**
- Bad: "check it out https://contentcreatortoolkit.carrd.co/"
- **Real deletion**: r/NewTubers删除了包含carrd.co链接的OP回复

❌ **提到 "built it using shell agent/myshell"**
- Bad: "built it using shell agent in about 30 minutes"
- **Real deletion**: r/NewTubers删除了提到shell agent的评论
- Reason: 明显的产品推广信号

❌ **在评论中直接@bot名 + 详细解释功能**
- Bad: "use a telegram bot (@Aillen_XHook_bot) that scores my hooks 1-100. you send it your hook script and it tells you: curiosity score, pattern interrupt, clarity score..."
- **Real deletion**: r/NewTubers删除了这种格式的评论
- Reason: 格式太像广告文案

---

### ✅ 安全的提及方式 (严格社区适用)

**Tier 1: 最安全 (适合r/NewTubers等严格社区)**
```
i use a telegram bot that generates title variations. costs like $4 for 50 uses. saves me from staring at a blank doc for 30 minutes.

happy to share more details if you dm me.
```
**特征**:
· 不提bot名字
· 不提shell agent/myshell
· 引导到私信

---

**Tier 2: 中等风险 (适合r/ContentMarketing等中等社区)**
```
tbh i use a bot called @YT_TitleBot for this. generates like 10 variations in different styles. costs $25/month but saves me 5+ hours/week so worth it for me.

they're not perfect tho, i still edit 30% of the outputs. but way faster than starting from scratch.
```
**特征**:
· 可以提bot名
· 承认不完美
· 不解释如何构建

---

**Tier 3: 低风险 (适合r/TelegramBots等宽松社区)**
```
oh nice! yeah so i built 3 main bots with shell agent:

· @ShellAgent_CaptionBot - generates caption variations
· @ShellAgent_ThumbGen - thumbnail variations
· @ShellAgent_Repurpose - repurposes long videos

took maybe an hour to set up all three. the caption bot alone saves me like 2 hours/week.
```
**特征**:
· 可以提bot名 + shell agent
· 可以列举功能
· 社区本身是bot相关,推广容忍度高

---

### 社区严格程度分级

**🔴 High Risk 严格社区 (Zero tolerance):**
- r/NewTubers (confirmed 2 deletion cases)
- r/YouTubers (confirmed 1 auto-filter case)
- **Strategy**: Tier 1 only - 不提bot名,引导私信

**🟡 Medium Risk 中等严格:**
- r/ContentMarketing
- r/GrowthHacking
- r/socialmedia (confirmed 1 auto-filter case)
- **Strategy**: Tier 2 - 可提bot名,不提构建方式

**🟢 Low Risk 宽松社区:**
- r/TelegramBots
- r/AI_Agents
- r/nocode
- **Strategy**: Tier 3 - 正常提及

---

### ❌ 当前问题：
· 过多破折号
· AI味太浓
· 没有提到Bot名字
· **新增**: 在严格社区提及方式过于明显(会被删)

**Bad Example**:
```
That sounds awesome — especially the Telegram one. Would love to see how you set that up or what it actually looks like in action. I've been wanting something similar but didn't know there were tools that make it that easy. Mind sharing a bit more?
```

**问题**:
· Em dash (—)
· "especially"（太正式）
· 结构太完美

---

### ✅ 自然的OP回复

#### 模板1：热情+具体回答+Bot名字
```
oh nice! yeah so i built 3 main bots:

1. Caption Generator Bot (@ShellAgent_CaptionBot) - you give it a topic and it spits out like 5 caption options. saves me so much time vs staring at a blank doc
2. Thumbnail Gen Bot (@ShellAgent_ThumbGen) - similar thing but for thumbnails. gives you 5 variations and you pick the best
3. Content Repurposer (@ShellAgent_Repurpose) - this one's my favorite. upload a youtube video and it automatically turns it into 10 shorter posts for twitter/linkedin/instagram

built all of them using shell agent which is a no-code bot builder. took maybe an hour total to set up.

the caption bot alone saves me like 2 hours/week cause i used to agonize over every single caption lol.

happy to share more details if you wanna know the specific workflow or how i trained them on my brand voice.
```

**特征**:
· Bot names in parentheses with @
· "oh nice!"（casual opener）
· "lol"
· "happy to share"（friendly close）
· 具体数字（"2 hours/week", "1 hour total"）

---

#### 模板2：谦虚+细节+鼓励
```
tbh it's not as complicated as it sounds. i'm not technical at all and i figured it out in like an afternoon.

i use shell agent (@ShellAgentBot on telegram) to build the bots. basically you just describe what you want in plain english and it generates the bot in like 10 minutes.

the three i use most are:
· title generator (@YT_TitleBot) - generates 10 youtube title variations
· shorts clipper (@ShortsClipBot) - takes a long video and clips it into 10 shorts automatically
· hook analyzer (@HookAnalyzer) - scores your video hooks 1-100

costs $25/month for unlimited bots. saves me like 10 hours/week so it's a no brainer for me.

if you end up trying it lmk how it goes. also happy to share my exact bot setup if that'd be helpful.
```

**特征**:
· "tbh", "lmk"（colloquialisms）
· Bot names with @
· Specific pricing
· "no brainer for me"（personal opinion, not sales pitch）
· "if that'd be helpful"（offer without pushing）

---

#### 模板3：回应怀疑+承认限制
```
totally get the skepticism. i was the same way tbh.

the main difference for me vs other tools i tried (zapier, chatgpt, etc) is that everything stays in telegram. no switching apps, no copy pasting, just send a message and get results back.

the bots i use:
· @ContentRepurposeBot - 1 video → 10 posts
· @TopicGenBot - scrapes reddit/twitter trends weekly
· @XPostGenBot - generates tweet threads

they're not perfect tho. like i still edit 20-30% of the outputs cause some of them are generic. but it's way faster than starting from scratch.

also failed to mention earlier but i built them all with shell agent. it's a no-code platform specifically for telegram bots. has a free playground if you wanna test before paying.

lmk if you have specific questions about any of the bots. always happy to nerd out about workflow stuff lol.
```

**特征**:
· 承认怀疑（"totally get it"）
· 承认不完美（"they're not perfect", "still edit 20-30%"）
· 对比其他工具（Zapier, ChatGPT）
· Bot names
· "lmk", "lol"
· "always happy to"（genuine offer）

---

## 7. 不同社区的语言风格调整

### r/GrowthHacking
**Tone**: 数据驱动、ROI焦点、专业但不正式

**关键词**:
· tested, experiment, data
· saved $X, ROI, cost reduction
· conversion, engagement, metrics
· not affiliated, just sharing results

**示例开头**:
```
ran an experiment over the last 3 months testing [X].

hypothesis was simple: [Y]

results:
· cost went from $2k/month to $25/month
· output stayed the same
· engagement dipped 10% initially but recovered

tl;dr: [conclusion]
```

---

### r/NewTubers ⚠️ HIGH RISK
**Tone**: 挣扎、共鸣、友好帮助

**⚠️ Moderation 严格程度**: 🔴 EXTREME - Confirmed 2 deletion cases

**推广策略**:
· 主帖可以分享经验,但不要提工具名
· OP回复不要@bot名,不要提shell agent
· 引导到私信: "happy to share more details if you dm me"
· 如果必须提,只说"telegram bot"或"automation tool"

**关键词**:
· stuck at, struggling with
· finally figured out, something clicked
· went from X views to Y views
· not affiliated, just sharing what helped me
· **避免**: "built with", "@BotName", specific tool links

**示例开头**:
```
been stuck at 100 views per video for 3 months and was honestly ready to quit.

then i changed [specific thing] and views jumped to 800 per video.

here's what i did: [details]

not saying this'll work for everyone but it def helped me break through that wall.
```

**Safe OP Reply (if asked about tools)**:
```
tbh i use some telegram automation for this. saves me like 2 hours/week. not perfect but way better than manual.

happy to share specifics in dm if you're curious. don't wanna spam the comments lol.
```

---

### r/ContentMarketing
**Tone**: 专业实践者、案例分享、开放讨论

**关键词**:
· been managing, running
· hypothesis, tested, results
· workflow, process, approach
· curious what others are seeing
· would love to hear

**示例开头**:
```
content marketer here managing 3 brands solo.

been testing [X approach] for the last month and seeing interesting results.

[data/details]

curious how others are handling [pain point]. what's your approach?
```

---

## Real Examples for Reference

### Example 1: Perfect Discussion Post（r/GrowthHacking）
```
Title: what's your biggest time sink in content creation rn?

Body:
been running social media for 2 brands and honestly feels like i spend more time on admin tasks (titles, captions, formatting) than actual content creation.

curious what's eating up the most time for other people here. is it:
· ideation (coming up with what to post)
· creation (actually making the content)
· distribution (posting across platforms)
· or something else i'm not thinking of?

trying to figure out if i should optimize my workflow or if everyone's just drowning in the same stuff lol.
```

**Why it works**:
· Relatable pain point
· Open question
· Invites everyone to participate
· No mention of solutions/tools
· "lol", "rn"（casual）
· lowercase "been"

---

### Example 2: Perfect Shill Comment
```
this hits home tbh.

i spend way too much time on caption writing specifically. like i'll film a video in 30 minutes and then spend another 30 minutes just staring at a blank doc trying to write the perfect caption. it's ridiculous.

tried using chatgpt for a while but copy pasting back and forth was almost as annoying as writing from scratch. been looking for something that integrates better into my actual workflow.

telegram bots sound interesting cause i'm already in telegram all day anyway. do you use any specific ones or did you build custom ones?
```

**Why it works**:
· 3 paragraphs
· Specific details（"30 minutes", "chatgpt", "copy pasting"）
· Shows previous attempts（ChatGPT）
· Doesn't ask for link directly
· Natural question at end
· "tbh", "like"（colloquialisms）

---

## Summary

**The Golden Rules**:
1. **不完美 > 完美**: Reddit用户不追求完美
2. **具体 > 泛泛而谈**: 数字、时间、具体工具名
3. **开放 > 推销**: 邀请讨论，不是pitch
4. **多样化 > 单一**: 不要全是"我做了X"的角度
5. **自然 > AI**: colloquialisms, 小写, 不完美语法

**When in doubt**:
· 问自己："如果我的朋友在群聊里说这个，会不会觉得weird？"
· 如果会，重写
· 如果不会，perfect
