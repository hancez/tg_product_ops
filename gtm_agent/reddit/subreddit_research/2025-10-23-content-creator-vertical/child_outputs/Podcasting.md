## Shell Agent Bot Mapping

### High-Relevance Bots (Podcast-Specific)

#### 1. **Content Repurposing Bot - Video to Copy** 🔥
- **Pain Point**: "should i switch to posting podcast clips on tiktok" - repurposing to short-form
- **Bot**: Upload video → convert core ideas to X short copy OR LinkedIn long copy
- **Post Angle**: "I turn every podcast episode into 10 X posts + 3 LinkedIn articles automatically"
- **Community Fit**: 🔥 **EXCELLENT** - Addresses repurposing pain

#### 2. **X Hook Generator Bot** (Adapted for podcast promo)
- **Pain Point**: Getting listeners to click on episodes
- **Bot**: Input core idea/topic → generate 10 viral X post hooks based on psychological triggers
- **Post Angle**: "I promote every podcast episode with 10 hook variations (saves 2 hours/week)"
- **Community Fit**: ✅ **GOOD** - Social media promotion is a struggle

#### 3. **Content Summarizer Bot** (Not yet built, but HIGH demand)
- **Pain Point**: "instructional PDF for guests" - need to prep guests, create show notes
- **Bot**: Input long video/article link → summarize key points
- **Post Angle**: "I auto-generate show notes from podcast recordings (no more manual transcription)"
- **Community Fit**: 🔥 **EXCELLENT** - Show notes are tedious

#### 4. **Guest Preparation Bot** (Hypothetical - not in toolkit)
- **Pain Point**: "What's the hardest part about finding good podcast guests?" (3 upvotes)
- **Bot**: Research guest → generate interview questions + talking points
- **Post Angle**: "I prep for every podcast interview in 10 minutes (used to take 2 hours)"
- **Community Fit**: ✅ **GOOD** - Guest prep is time-consuming

#### 5. **Podcast Clip Selector Bot** (Hypothetical - not in toolkit)
- **Pain Point**: "posting podcast clips on tiktok"
- **Bot**: Upload podcast episode → auto-detect "golden quotes" or highlights → suggest clip timestamps
- **Post Angle**: "I find viral-worthy clips in my 1-hour podcasts automatically"
- **Community Fit**: ✅ **GOOD** - Clipping is manual work

## Recommended GTM Strategy

### Approach 1: **Weekly Services Thread (Direct Promotion)**

**Why This Works**:
- **Designated space** for tool promotion (8 upvotes, low competition)
- **Low risk** - explicitly allowed by rules
- **Targeted audience** - people browsing services thread are actively seeking tools

**Recommended Post Format for Services Thread**:
```
**Telegram Bots for Podcast Workflow Automation**

I built a suite of Telegram bots to streamline my podcast production. Thought I'd share in case others find them useful.

**What they do:**
1. **Video to Copy Bot**: Upload your podcast episode → get 10 X-ready posts + 3 LinkedIn articles (for promotion)
2. **Show Notes Generator**: Upload recording → get auto-generated show notes with timestamps
3. **Hook Generator**: Input episode topic → get 10 viral hook variations for social media promo

**Who it's for:** Podcasters who want to save time on post-production and promotion (not the recording/editing itself).

**Built with:** Shell Agent (no-code Telegram bot builder). You can remix my bots or build your own by describing what you need in plain English.

**Pricing:** $25/month for Shell Agent subscription (includes all bots + ability to build more).

**Feedback Requested:** Do these bots solve real pain points for you, or am I off-base? What other podcast workflows would you want to automate?

Happy to answer questions or share links via DM (don't want to spam the thread).
```

**Why This Format Works**:
- ✅ Fits Weekly Services Thread guidelines ("Post a podcasting related product, tool, or service")
- ✅ Lists specific use cases (not vague "automation")
- ✅ Asks for feedback (community-oriented)
- ✅ "Feedback Requested" tag encouraged by thread rules

### Approach 2: **Main Feed - Educational "Workflow Share"**

**Why This Works**:
- **"Instructional PDF" post got 10 upvotes** - community appreciates helpful resources
- **Not direct promotion** - educational content about workflow optimization

**Recommended Post Format for Main Feed**:
```
Title: "How I streamlined my podcast workflow (from 8 hours to 3 hours per episode)"

Body:
I host a [niche] podcast. Used to spend 8+ hours per episode:
- 2 hours recording
- 3 hours editing
- 1 hour writing show notes
- 2 hours creating social media promo content

Now it's 3.5 hours total. Here's what I automated:

**1. Show Notes (saved 1 hour/episode)**
I upload my recording to a Telegram bot (Show Notes Generator). It transcribes, timestamps, and formats show notes automatically.

**2. Social Media Promo (saved 2 hours/episode)**
I use two bots:
- Hook Generator: Input episode topic → get 10 hook variations for X/LinkedIn
- Video to Copy Bot: Upload episode → get 10 X posts + 3 LinkedIn articles

I pick the best hooks, tweak them, and schedule.

**3. Guest Prep (saved 30 min/episode)**
I built a simple bot that scrapes my guest's LinkedIn/X → generates interview questions. Not perfect, but gives me a starting point.

**Workflow now:**
- Record (2 hours)
- Edit (1 hour)
- Run bots for notes + promo (15 min)
- Review/tweak bot outputs (15 min)

Went from 8 hours to 3.5 hours. That's 18 hours saved per month (for a 4-episode/month cadence).

**Tools I use:**
- Telegram bots (built with Shell Agent, a no-code bot builder)
- Descript (editing)
- Calendly (guest scheduling)

Not trying to sell anything, just sharing my workflow. Happy to answer questions if anyone wants specifics on the bots or how I set them up.
```

**Why This Format Works**:
- ✅ Educational (not promotional)
- ✅ Specific time savings (8h → 3.5h)
- ✅ Matches "instructional PDF" post's helpful vibe
- ✅ Natural tool mentions (not salesy)

## Comment Interaction Strategy

### When users ask "Can you share the bots?"
**Response**:
> "Sure! I built them with Shell Agent (no-code Telegram bot builder). The three main ones are:
> 1. Show Notes Generator
> 2. Hook Generator (for social media)
> 3. Video to Copy Bot (episode → text posts)
>
> They're all in my Telegram, but Shell Agent has a Playground where you can test building bots for free. I use the $25/month plan now because it saves me 18 hours/month (worth it for me)."

### When users ask "Is this just AI transcription?"
**Response**:
> "Partially, yeah. The Show Notes Generator uses AI transcription + formatting. But the Hook Generator and Video to Copy Bot are different - they analyze the content and generate promotional copy optimized for each platform (X vs. LinkedIn).
>
> It's less 'transcribe' and more 'repurpose content for different audiences.'"

### When users ask "How did you build these?"
**Response**:
> "I used Shell Agent - you describe what you want in plain English and it builds the bot in ~10 minutes. I'm not a coder, so this was perfect.
>
> I built all 3 bots in one weekend. You can also remix existing bots in their library if you don't want to start from scratch."

## Execution Timeline

### Week 1: Weekly Services Thread (Low-Risk Test)
- **Tuesday** (when Services Thread is posted): Post tool description (use Approach 1 format)
- **Tuesday-Friday**: Reply to any comments, answer questions
- **Friday**: Analyze engagement (upvotes, comments, DMs)

### Week 2-3: Main Feed Post (If Services Thread Successful)
- **Week 2**: Draft workflow optimization post (use Approach 2 format)
- **Week 3**: Post in main feed, monitor engagement

### Success Criteria
**Services Thread**:
- **3+ upvotes OR 2+ comments** → Strong interest, proceed to main feed
- **0-2 upvotes + 0 comments** → Low interest, revisit bot offering

**Main Feed Post**:
- **10+ upvotes** → Strong resonance, this channel works
- **5-9 upvotes** → Moderate success, try different angle
- **<5 upvotes** → Community may not prioritize efficiency (focus elsewhere)

---

## Risk Factors

1. **Rules partially verified**: "Designated areas only" confirmed, but main feed rules unclear
   - **Mitigation**: Start with Services Thread (zero risk), then test main feed
2. **Low engagement on Services Thread**: Only 8 upvotes/8 comments on latest thread
   - **Mitigation**: Low competition = easier to stand out
3. **Technical community**: May have DIY mindset (prefer building own solutions)
   - **Mitigation**: Emphasize "no-code" and "remix" capabilities

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Tier 1 community** - Clear pain points (repurposing, promo, show notes)
✅ **Designated self-promo space** - Weekly Services Thread (LOW RISK)
✅ **Educational content is welcome** - "Instructional PDF" got 10 upvotes
🔥 **Best bots to feature**:
1. Content Repurposing Bot - Video to Copy (podcast → text posts)
2. Show Notes Generator (transcription + formatting)
3. Hook Generator (social media promo)

✅ **Clear execution path**:
1. Test in Services Thread first (Week 1)
2. If successful, post workflow guide in main feed (Week 2-3)

**Recommendation**: **Proceed with Tier 1 execution** - Start with Services Thread this week. This community has lower competition than YouTube communities and clear tool adoption potential.
