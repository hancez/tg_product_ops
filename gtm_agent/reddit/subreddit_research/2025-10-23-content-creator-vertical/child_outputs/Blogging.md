## Rules Analysis

### Self-Promotion Policy [推断]
**Status**: Partial info from Tavily: "Reddit is pretty strict about self promo"

**Inference from Hot Threads**:
- ✅ **Monthly feedback threads exist**: "October Feedback Thread" and "October Questions Thread" (pinned)
- ✅ **Self-promo allowed in designated threads**: Feedback thread description: "Post your feedback request here"
- ⚠️ **Main feed is strict**: Tavily hint + no tool pitches in hot threads = strict main feed
- ✅ **Experience sharing is okay**: "3 years, 4 blogs, 2k a month" post shares monetization journey

**Observation from "3 years, 4 blogs" post** (Tavily result):
> "Reddit is pretty strict about self promo so the key is to genuinely engage and add value first. Share your expertise, comment on others' posts and only..."

**推断规则**:
- **Main feed**: No direct self-promo, but experience sharing with embedded tool mentions okay
- **Feedback thread**: Self-promo allowed (monthly)
- **Must build karma first**: "genuinely engage and add value first"

**Risk Level**: **MEDIUM** - Clear designated space (feedback thread), but main feed is strict

## Shell Agent Bot Mapping

### High-Relevance Bots (Blogger-Specific)

#### 1. **Topic Generator Bot** 🔥
- **Pain Point**: "Google's AI Overview is killing traffic" - need to find topics AI can't steal
- **Bot**: Input niche/keyword → scrape social media hot discussions → generate 10-20 topic suggestions with reference links
- **Post Angle**: "I stopped competing with AI and started writing what people are ACTUALLY asking on Reddit/X"
- **Community Fit**: 🔥 **EXCELLENT** - Addresses #1 concern (AI stealing traffic)

#### 2. **X Post Generator Bot** (Can be adapted for blog ideas)
- **Pain Point**: "How much traffic are you doing?" - need consistent posting
- **Bot**: Provide 5 reference posts → input topic → generate 3-5 posts in learned style
- **Post Angle**: "I went from publishing 1 post/week to 5 posts/week using AI to maintain my voice"
- **Community Fit**: ✅ **GOOD** - Consistency is a common struggle

#### 3. **Content Summarizer Bot** (Not yet built, but HIGH demand)
- **Pain Point**: "3 years, 4 blogs" - managing multiple blogs is time-consuming
- **Bot**: Input long article link → summarize key points → convert to blog post outline
- **Post Angle**: "I manage 4 blogs without burning out (here's my content recycling system)"
- **Community Fit**: ✅ **GOOD** - Multi-blog management is tough

#### 4. **Viral Idea Spark Bot**
- **Pain Point**: Finding topics that aren't already covered by AI
- **Bot**: Input niche → monitor & push trending topics from TikTok, X, Instagram
- **Post Angle**: "I track trending topics in my niche automatically (stopped guessing what to write)"
- **Community Fit**: ✅ **GOOD** - Topic discovery is a pain point

## Recommended GTM Strategy

### Approach: **A4 - "How I Adapted to AI Era" Story**

**Why This Works**:
- Community is **obsessed with AI impact** (50 upvotes on AI traffic post)
- Must **acknowledge the threat** before offering solution
- "Here's what I learned" format gets 16+ upvotes

**Recommended Post Format**:
```
Title: "My blog lost 40% traffic to Google AI. Here's how I adapted (and grew anyway)."

Body:
I run a [niche] blog. In March 2025, Google rolled out AI Overviews to my keywords. My organic traffic dropped from 10k/month to 6k/month overnight.

I panicked. Then I realized: AI answers basic questions. I need to write what AI CAN'T answer.

**What I changed:**

1. **Stopped writing "What is X?" posts**
AI owns these now. No point competing.

2. **Started writing "My experience with X" posts**
AI can't replicate personal experience. Example: "What is SEO?" (AI wins) vs. "I spent $2k on SEO courses. Here's what actually worked" (AI can't write this).

3. **Focused on Reddit/X-trending topics**
I built a Telegram bot (Topic Generator) that monitors Reddit, X, and Google Trends for my niche. Every Monday, it sends me 10 trending questions people are asking RIGHT NOW.

I write posts answering those questions BEFORE they show up in AI training data.

**Results:**
- Traffic recovered to 9k/month (close to pre-AI levels)
- Engagement UP (comments doubled because I'm writing what people actually care about)
- Newsletter signups UP 3x (personal experience = trust)

**Full transparency:**
- This won't make you rich overnight
- AI will keep evolving
- But focusing on **what AI can't steal** (personal experience, timely trends, community discussions) has kept my blog alive.

Tools I use:
- Topic Generator Bot (Telegram) - monitors trends
- Google Trends (manual checks)
- Reddit search (manual checks)

Happy to share more about my workflow if anyone's interested. We're all figuring this out together.
```

**Why This Format Works**:
- ✅ Leads with shared pain ("lost 40% traffic to AI")
- ✅ Provides specific adaptation strategy
- ✅ Addresses #1 community concern (AI stealing traffic)
- ✅ Embeds tool mention naturally (not salesy)
- ✅ "We're all figuring this out" creates solidarity

## Comment Interaction Strategy

### When users ask "What bot did you use?"
**Response**:
> "I built it with Shell Agent (no-code Telegram bot builder). It scrapes Reddit, X, and Google Trends for my niche and sends me a weekly digest.
>
> Took me about 20 minutes to set up. I'm not technical at all, so if I can do it, anyone can.
>
> The bot basically saves me 2 hours/week of manual trend research."

### When users ask "Isn't this just using AI to compete with AI?"
**Response**:
> "Kind of, but here's the difference:
> - AI Overviews answer questions using OLD training data (6-12 months old)
> - My bot finds questions people are asking RIGHT NOW (last 7 days)
>
> So I'm writing fresh content that won't show up in AI Overviews for months. By then, I've already captured the traffic."

### When users ask "How do I build a similar bot?"
**Response**:
> "Shell Agent has a Playground where you can test it for free. You describe what you want in plain English (e.g., 'Monitor r/[your niche] for trending questions'), and it builds the bot.
>
> I use the $25/month plan now, but you can start with the free trial to see if it works for your workflow."

## Alternative: Feedback Thread Strategy

### Approach: **Participate in Monthly Feedback Thread**

**Why This Works**:
- **Lower risk** than main feed (self-promo is allowed)
- **Less competition** (feedback threads get 1 upvote, low traffic)
- **Can directly link to Shell Agent**

**Hypothetical Comment in Feedback Thread**:
```
I've been using Telegram bots to automate my blog workflow (topic research, content repurposing). Went from 1 post/week to 5 posts/week.

Blog: [link]

Looking for feedback on:
1. Does my content feel "too automated"?
2. Are my topics relevant or am I off-base?

Happy to share the bots I use if anyone's curious (they're all built with Shell Agent, a no-code bot builder).
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Asks for feedback (primary purpose of thread)
- ✅ Mentions automation naturally
- ✅ Offers to share tools (not pushy)

---

## Execution Timeline

### Option 1: Main Feed (Higher Reach, Higher Risk)
- **Week 1**: Build karma (comment on 5-10 posts)
- **Week 2**: Post "How I adapted to AI" story
- **Week 3**: Monitor engagement, reply to comments

### Option 2: Feedback Thread (Lower Reach, Lower Risk)
- **This Month**: Comment in October Feedback Thread
- **Next Month**: If positive response, post in main feed

**Recommendation**: Start with **Option 2** (Feedback Thread) to test community reception, then escalate to **Option 1** (Main Feed) if successful.

---

## Risk Factors

1. **Rules partially verified**: "Strict about self promo" hint from Tavily
   - **Mitigation**: Lead with AI adaptation story (pure value), tool mention is secondary
2. **AI anxiety may create "tool fatigue"**: Community may be skeptical of AI-powered tools
   - **Mitigation**: Frame bot as "human-curated trend monitoring" not "AI writing"
3. **Low engagement on feedback threads**: 1 upvote on monthly threads
   - **Mitigation**: Use feedback thread as karma-builder, not primary GTM channel

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Tier 2 community** - Active, but strict self-promo rules
🔥 **AI anxiety is HIGH** - 50 upvotes on "AI killing traffic" post = golden opportunity
✅ **Topic Generator Bot is perfect fit** - Addresses #1 concern (finding topics AI can't steal)
✅ **Experience sharing format works** - 16 upvotes on "3 years, 4 blogs"
⚠️ **Rules partially verified** - "Strict about self promo" confirmed, but details missing

**Best bot to feature**:
- Topic Generator Bot - "I track trends AI can't steal yet"

**Recommendation**: **Start with Feedback Thread** to test reception, then escalate to main feed with "How I adapted to AI" story if successful.
