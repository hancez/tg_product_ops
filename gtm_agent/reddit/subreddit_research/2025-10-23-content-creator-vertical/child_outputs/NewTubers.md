## Recommended GTM Strategy

### Approach: **A4 - "What I Learned" / Milestone Story**

**Why This Works for r/NewTubers**:
- Community **celebrates small wins** (167 upvotes on "1k views" post)
- **"What worked for me"** posts get 90+ upvotes
- Beginners are **desperate for actionable advice**

**Recommended Post Format**:
```
Title: "I went from 50 views per video to 2k views in 3 months (here's the 3 changes I made)"

Body:
I started YouTube 6 months ago. For the first 3 months, every video got 50-150 views and I was ready to quit.

Then I changed 3 things and now I'm averaging 2k views per video. Nothing crazy, but it's growth.

**Change 1: I stopped guessing titles**
Used to spend 10 minutes thinking of a title, then it would flop. Now I generate 10 title variations using a Telegram bot (YouTube Clickbait Title Generator), test them with friends, and pick the best. My CTR went from 2% to 5.8%.

**Change 2: I made thumbnail creation a system**
Used to spend 30 min in Canva struggling with design. Now I use a bot to generate 5 thumbnail options in under 1 minute (YouTube Thumbnail Bot). I pick one, tweak colors if needed, done. Saved 2 hours/week.

**Change 3: I repurposed my content**
Every long video now becomes 5-10 Shorts automatically (Content Repurposing Bot). I went from posting 1 video/week to posting 1 long + 10 Shorts/week. Shorts drive traffic back to my main channel.

Tools I use:
- YouTube Title Generator (Telegram bot)
- YouTube Thumbnail Generator (Telegram bot)
- Shorts Clipper (Telegram bot)

All built with Shell Agent (no-code bot builder). Costs $25/month, saves me 10+ hours/month.

Not affiliated with them, just sharing what helped me break through the "stuck at 100 views" phase.

Happy to answer questions!
```

**Why This Format Crushes**:
- ✅ Leads with milestone (50 → 2k views) - community LOVES milestones
- ✅ Provides specific metrics (CTR 2% → 5.8%)
- ✅ Solves #1 beginner problem (visibility/growth)
- ✅ Tool mentions embedded in value (not salesy)
- ✅ "I was ready to quit" creates emotional connection

## Comment Interaction Strategy

### When users ask "Which Telegram bot builder?"
**Response**:
> "I use Shell Agent. It's a no-code platform where you describe your bot in plain English and it builds it in ~10 minutes. I'm not technical at all, so this was perfect.
>
> I built all 3 bots in one weekend:
> 1. Title generator (input topic, get 10 titles)
> 2. Thumbnail generator (input idea, get 5 designs)
> 3. Shorts clipper (upload video, get 10 clips)
>
> They have a free Playground if you want to test before paying. I upgraded to $25/month because it saves me 10 hours/month (totally worth it for me)."

### When users ask "Can you share the bots?"
**Response**:
> "DM me and I'll send links! Don't want to spam the thread. But honestly, the cool part is you can also build your own bots if you have specific needs. Shell Agent lets you remix existing bots or create new ones just by describing what you want."

### When users ask "Is this actually helpful or just AI slop?"
**Response**:
> "Fair skepticism. Here's what the bots DON'T do:
> - They don't write my scripts (I do that)
> - They don't film my videos (I do that)
> - They don't edit my videos (I do that)
>
> What they DO:
> - Generate title options (I pick the best)
> - Generate thumbnail options (I tweak and finalize)
> - Clip my long video into Shorts (I review and post)
>
> Think of it like having an assistant for brainstorming and grunt work. I still make all creative decisions."
