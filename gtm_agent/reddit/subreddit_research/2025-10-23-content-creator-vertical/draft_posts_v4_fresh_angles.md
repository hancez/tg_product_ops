### Main Post

**Title**: does anyone else feel like youtube is getting impossible for small channels?

**Body**:
been uploading for 8 months. spent hours learning premiere, after effects, thumbnail design. watch every "how to grow on youtube" video. follow all the advice.

my videos get 30-80 views. meanwhile some random person posts a 2-minute phone recording and gets 10k views.

starting to feel like the algorithm just picks favorites and if you're not one of them you're screwed.

is it actually possible to grow from zero in 2025 or should i just accept this is a hobby?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

I felt this so hard 6 months ago. Was about to quit YouTube entirely.

What changed for me was realizing I was optimizing the wrong thing. I was spending 8 hours editing videos to perfection but only 10 minutes on titles. Turns out YouTube doesn't show your video to anyone if your title doesn't tell the algorithm what it's about.

Started spending way more time on metadata (titles, descriptions, tags) and less time on editing. My impressions went from 200 to 2,000 per video literally overnight. Same quality videos, just better packaging.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

wait really? i've been obsessing over editing quality cause i thought that's what makes channels blow up. you're saying titles matter more?

how do you even write good titles? i usually just describe what's in the video.

---

### Shill Comment 2

yeah titles matter way more than people think. descriptive titles are good for search but curiosity-based titles get way more clicks from browse features and suggested.

i started using @youtube_clickbait_title_bot to generate variations. it gives you like 5-7 options in different styles (descriptive, curiosity, clickbait, hybrid). you pick what fits your video. costs like $4 for 50 generations or something.

still edit them to match my voice but way faster than staring at a blank doc. also helps you see patterns in what makes titles work vs flop.

### Main Post

**Title**: What's your take on AI content? Are we all screwed or is this a gold rush?

**Body**:
Content marketer here. Been doing this for 5 years.

Everyone in my circle is either:
1. Panicking that AI will replace content marketers
2. Excited that AI will 10x productivity

I'm somewhere in the middle. I've tested a bunch of AI tools and honestly the output is still pretty mediocre without heavy editing. But it does save time on first drafts.

Curious what's working for people who've actually integrated AI into their workflow (not just "I tried ChatGPT once").

What tools are you using daily? What's overhyped? What's actually useful?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

tbh most ai content tools are trash. they all generate the same generic stuff cause they're all using the same models with slightly different prompts.

what's actually useful is super specific niche tools that do one thing really well. like i use @xPostGenerator_Bot for twitter threads and @CFLinkedinPostBot for linkedin posts. they're way more focused than "generate any content for any platform" tools which always end up generic.

the catch is you still need to edit like 30-40% of the output to add specifics and personality. but that's way faster than writing from scratch. went from spending 45 minutes per post to like 15 minutes with editing.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

That makes sense. The "do everything" AI tools I've tried always felt too generic to be useful.

How often do you use those bots? Daily or just when you're stuck?

---

### Shill Comment 2

i use them like 3-4 times per week when i'm planning my content calendar. usually on sundays i batch generate drafts for the whole week and then edit them throughout the week before posting.

the twitter one especially helps cause twitter threads are such a pain to format. it handles the structure and i just add personality and specific examples. costs a few bucks per batch which is way cheaper than hiring a writer.

### Main Post

**Title**: is content marketing just spam at this point?

**Body**:
Genuinely asking cause I'm starting to feel gross about what I do.

I write blog posts optimized for SEO keywords nobody actually searches. I post on linkedin pretending to care about topics I don't. I send emails to people who probably don't want them.

Most of my work is just trying to trick algorithms into showing my stuff to people. That's not marketing, that's spam with extra steps.

Anyone else feel this way or did I just pick the wrong career?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

I went through this exact crisis last year.

What helped me was switching from "content for algorithms" to "content for actual people with actual problems." Sounds obvious but it's a big mindset shift.

Instead of "top 10 [keyword] tools for [keyword]" listicles, I started writing stuff like "I wasted $5k testing marketing tools so you don't have to." Way more honest, way more useful, and ironically performs better algorithmically too because people actually engage with it.

The spam feeling went away when I stopped trying to game systems and started just helping people make decisions.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

This resonates a lot. I've been so focused on "what will rank" that I forgot to ask "would I actually want to read this?"

Do you still do keyword research or just write whatever feels helpful?

---

### Shill Comment 2

i still do light keyword research but it's more like "is anyone actually searching for this topic" vs "how do i rank for this exact phrase." like i'll use @Viral_Idea_Spark_Bot to see what's trending in my niche and then write about the topics people are actually discussing right now. way more relevant than evergreen seo content that sits there forever.

also helps me avoid writing about oversaturated topics where there's already 500 blog posts saying the same thing.

### Main Post

**Title**: writing 2000 words per post is killing my soul

**Body**:
everyone says "long form content ranks better" so i've been forcing myself to write 2000+ word blog posts.

problem is half of it is just filler to hit the word count. i could say the same thing in 800 words but then it "won't rank."

feels like i'm optimizing for robots instead of readers. does anyone actually read 2000 word blog posts or do they just skim and leave?

starting to think shorter posts that actually say something useful would perform better.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

dude i feel this so hard. i was doing the same thing and my bounce rate was like 75% cause nobody wants to read that much text.

switched to writing however long the topic actually needs and then using specific examples and data to make it feel substantial. like instead of padding with generic advice i'll add case studies, screenshots, real numbers.

my posts are now like 1200 words average instead of 2000 but engagement went up cause people actually finish reading them. google doesn't seem to care about word count as much as people think.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

that's reassuring. i've been stressing about word count for months.

do you plan your posts around specific examples ahead of time or just write and add them during editing?

---

### Shill Comment 2

i usually outline first with the main points i want to make and then during writing i pull in examples as they come to mind. sometimes i'll use @Topic_generator8_bot to brainstorm angles if i'm stuck on how to make a topic interesting. it'll suggest like 5-7 different ways to approach the same topic and i pick the one that feels most useful.

helps me avoid writing generic "what is [topic]" posts and lean more into "here's how [topic] worked for me" which is way easier to write authentically.

### Main Post

**Title**: How do solopreneurs manage content + product + sales + everything?

**Body**:
Solo founder here building a SaaS product.

Every "expert" says I need to:
- Post daily on Twitter
- Write weekly blog posts
- Send weekly newsletter
- Create YouTube videos
- Be active on LinkedIn

Meanwhile I also need to:
- Build the actual product
- Talk to customers
- Fix bugs
- Handle support

There's literally not enough hours in the day. How do people actually do this? Are successful solopreneurs just not sleeping?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

honestly i think most "successful solopreneurs" you see online either have a team they're not mentioning or they're full of shit about how much they actually do.

what worked for me was picking like 2 channels max and ignoring the rest. i do twitter + blog and that's it. linkedin and youtube can wait until i have revenue to hire help.

also i batch everything. like i'll spend 3 hours on sunday generating a week's worth of twitter content using @xPostGenerator_Bot and then just schedule it throughout the week. same with blog posts. batch the creation so i'm not context switching every day.

not perfect but at least i'm not burning out trying to be everywhere.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

The batching idea makes sense. I've been trying to do everything daily and it's exhausting.

How much editing do those generated posts usually need? Curious if it actually saves time or if you spend just as long editing.

---

### Shill Comment 2

editing takes like 20-30% of the time writing from scratch would take. the bot handles structure and basic ideas but i add specifics about my product and personality. still saves me probably 2 hours per week which is huge when you're solo.

the key is not expecting perfect output. it's a starting point not a finished product.

### Main Post

**Title**: burned out on my side project before it even launched

**Body**:
been building a side project for 6 months. finally getting close to launch.

but now i'm supposed to "build an audience" and "create content" and i just... don't want to.

i like building. i don't like marketing. every time i open twitter to post something i feel like a fraud trying to sell something nobody asked for.

is it possible to launch without doing all the content marketing stuff or is that just how it works now?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

I get this completely. Marketing felt super unnatural to me too.

What helped was reframing it as "documenting the build" instead of "marketing." Like instead of trying to sell, I just shared what I was working on, what problems I was solving, what mistakes I made. Way less salesy, felt more authentic.

Turns out people actually care about the behind-the-scenes way more than polished pitches. My "I spent a week debugging this stupid bug" tweets got more engagement than any of my "check out my product" tweets.

You're already building, just show people what you're building and why.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

That's a way better framing. I've been trying to write "marketing copy" when I should just be sharing the process.

Do you have a schedule for posting or just whenever something interesting happens?

---

### Shill Comment 2

mostly just whenever something happens. like if i solve a hard problem or learn something new i'll tweet about it. maybe 3-4 times a week.

sometimes if i'm stuck i'll use @Viral_Idea_Spark_Bot to see what's trending in my space and comment on those discussions. easier than trying to come up with original takes every day. costs like $3-4 per search and usually surfaces 2-3 conversations worth joining.

# OBSERVATION/DISCOVERY POSTS

## Post 7: r/YouTubers - Observation
**Style**: OP (Lowercase), Shill 1 (Proper caps), OP Reply (Lowercase)

### Main Post

**Title**: realized i'm making content for the algorithm instead of for humans

**Body**:
been chasing "what the algorithm wants" for months. packing keywords into titles, making videos exactly 8 minutes for mid-rolls, copying whatever's trending.

my views went up a bit but my comments went down. people aren't engaging anymore cause the content is generic.

had this moment last week where i made a video about something i actually cared about, didn't optimize anything, just talked about it honestly. it did way better than my "optimized" videos.

makes me wonder if i've been doing this backwards the whole time.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

This is such a real observation.

I went through the same thing where I was so focused on "algorithm hacks" that my videos lost all personality. They performed okay but nobody cared enough to subscribe or comment.

When I switched to just making stuff I genuinely wanted to watch, my retention went up like 40%. Turns out people can tell when you're just chasing trends vs actually passionate about the topic.

The algorithm responds to engagement so if your content gets people to watch longer and comment more, it performs better anyway. Optimizing for humans is optimizing for the algorithm.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

yeah this is clicking for me now. i've been so focused on thumbnails and titles that i forgot the actual video needs to be worth watching.

how do you balance making stuff you care about with making stuff that gets views? sometimes those things don't overlap.

---

### Shill Comment 2

honestly i just make what i care about and trust that some subset of people will care too. if a video flops it flops. but at least i'm building an audience of people who actually like my stuff vs randoms who clicked a clickbait title and bounced.

for titles i'll use @youtube_clickbait_title_bot to test variations but i pick the ones that feel honest to the video content. not gonna lie about what's in the video just to get clicks.

### Main Post

**Title**: Why do my best edited videos flop and my lazy ones blow up?

**Body**:
This has happened 3 times now and I'm so confused.

Video A: Spent 12 hours editing. Motion graphics, color grading, perfect audio. 150 views.

Video B: Filmed on my phone, barely edited, uploaded same day. 2,500 views.

What am I missing? Is editing not actually important or am I just bad at picking topics?

Starting to think I should stop trying so hard lol.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

editing quality doesn't matter nearly as much as people think. like it matters for retention once someone clicks but it doesn't affect whether they click in the first place.

what matters way more is topic selection and packaging. if your title and thumbnail aren't interesting nobody's gonna click no matter how good the editing is. but if your title and thumbnail are fire people will watch even if the editing is mid.

your phone video probably just had a better topic or better title than your polished one. youtube shows videos based on click-through rate not production quality.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

That actually makes so much sense. My phone video was about a trending topic and my edited one was about something I just thought was interesting.

So I should spend more time picking topics and less time on editing?

---

### Shill Comment 2

yeah basically. i spend like 30 minutes per video on topic research now. i'll check what's trending using @Topic_generator8_bot or just scroll through my niche and see what people are asking about. then i make the video about that.

editing i keep super simple. jump cuts, basic b-roll, done. saves me like 8 hours per video and performance is basically the same. turns out nobody cares if you have fancy transitions as long as the content is relevant to what they searched for.

### Main Post

**Title**: Competitor gets 10x my engagement with objectively worse content. What am I missing?

**Body**:
Content marketer for 3 years. I write well-researched, data-backed posts with original insights.

My competitor writes basic listicles with recycled advice and gets 10x my engagement.

At first I thought it was their audience size but I checked—we have similar follower counts.

Then I thought maybe it's their posting frequency but they post less than me.

I'm genuinely stumped. Is quality content just not what performs anymore? Or am I missing something about what "quality" actually means?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

I've noticed this too and I think "quality" means different things to different audiences.

Your well-researched posts might be higher quality objectively but if they're dense and hard to skim, people won't engage. Meanwhile basic listicles are easy to consume and easy to react to.

I've been testing this and found that my "definitive guides" get read but don't get shared. My "quick tip" posts get shared like crazy even though they're way less detailed. People share what's easy to explain to their friends, not what's comprehensive.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

That's a frustrating but useful insight. So I should be optimizing for shareability over comprehensiveness?

---

### Shill Comment 2

kinda yeah. or at least testing both formats to see what your audience actually wants. i'll use @CFLinkedinPostBot sometimes to generate a few different versions of the same idea - one detailed, one punchy, one conversational - and see which performs better. costs like $4 for a batch of drafts.

usually the shorter punchier ones perform better even though they feel less "valuable" to me as the writer. but if nobody reads the comprehensive version then it's not actually valuable lol.

### Main Post

**Title**: content marketing is basically just gambling now

**Body**:
been posting content for a year. tracked everything in a spreadsheet.

can't find any patterns. sometimes short posts blow up. sometimes long posts blow up. sometimes posting at 8am works. sometimes 2pm works. sometimes controversial takes get engagement. sometimes they flop.

feels like i'm just rolling dice hoping for a hit. is there actually a strategy here or is it all just luck and volume?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

lol yeah it does feel random as hell. i think the "strategy" is just posting consistently enough that you eventually hit something that works and then trying to replicate that pattern.

what helped me was narrowing down to like 2-3 post formats that at least perform consistently even if they don't blow up. like i know "personal failure stories" always get decent engagement even if they never go viral. so when i need reliable engagement i use that format.

the viral hits are luck but you can at least have a baseline strategy that works reliably.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

that makes sense. i've been chasing viral hits instead of focusing on consistent performers.

what formats have you found work reliably?

---

### Shill Comment 2

for me it's personal stories, specific data breakdowns (like "tested X for 30 days here's the numbers"), and asking open questions that invite debate. those three always get at least 20-30 comments even if they don't go viral.

sometimes i'll use @X_Rival_Analysis_bot to see what formats are working for competitors and test those too. costs like $5 per analysis but surfaces patterns i wouldn't notice just scrolling. like i found out one competitor gets way more engagement on weekend posts which i never would've tested otherwise.

### Main Post

**Title**: I posted 10 shorts in 10 days with identical content but different hooks. Results were insane.

**Body**:
Ran this experiment to figure out if hooks actually matter or if it's all luck.

Made 10 shorts with basically the same content (me explaining a concept) but changed the first 3 seconds each time.

Results:
- Hook 1 (question format): 450 views
- Hook 2 (bold claim): 1,800 views
- Hook 3 (personal story): 120 views
- Hook 4 (stat/number): 920 views
- Hook 5 (relatability): 2,400 views
- Hook 6-10 (various): 200-600 views

Same exact content. The hook made a 20x difference.

I'm never spending time on anything except the hook again lol.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is super interesting. i've been focusing on video quality and completely ignoring hooks cause i thought shorts were just random.

what was the "relatability" hook that got 2400 views? trying to understand what that format looks like.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

It was "ever notice how [relatable frustration]?" followed by the explanation.

For example: "ever notice how you can edit a video for 8 hours and it gets 50 views but your random shower thought gets 5000?"

People clicked cause they related to the frustration and wanted to know why it happens.

---

### Shill Comment 2

oh that's smart. starting with a frustration people already feel vs trying to convince them to care about your topic. i'm gonna test this format.

do you write these hooks in advance or come up with them on the spot?

---

### OP Reply to Shill (continued)

I batch write them now. Every Sunday I use @Hook_Generator_Bot to generate like 20 hook variations for my topic and pick the top 5. Costs maybe $4-5 for 50 generations.

Way faster than brainstorming on the spot and it forces me to test different formats instead of just using the same hook style every time.

**Title**: tested AI thumbnail vs my design vs stock photo. here's what happened

**Body**:
YouTuber for 2 years. Thumbnails have always been my weakness.

Decided to test 3 approaches:
- Video A: Spent 2 hours designing thumbnail in Canva
- Video B: Used AI thumbnail generator (@myshell_thumbmaker_bot)
- Video C: Used stock photo + text overlay (5 minutes)

Posted at same time, same topic, similar video quality.

Results after 7 days:
- Canva design: 3.2% CTR, 850 impressions
- AI thumbnail: 5.8% CTR, 1,400 impressions
- Stock photo: 2.1% CTR, 600 impressions

The AI one crushed my "careful design" lol. Not sure how to feel about this.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

This is really interesting. I've been spending forever on thumbnails thinking it mattered a lot.

Did the AI thumbnail look obviously AI-generated or did it look natural? Wondering if people clicked because it looked professional or despite looking like AI.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

It looked pretty clean actually. Not obviously AI but also not super polished. I think it worked because it was just really eye-catching with high contrast colors and bold text.

My Canva design was more "tasteful" but less attention-grabbing.

---

### Shill Comment 2

yeah i've noticed this too. the "ugly" high-contrast thumbnails with huge text perform way better than the "pretty" minimalist ones. youtube is so competitive that you need to basically scream to get noticed.

i still edit the ai thumbnails like 20-30% to match my channel style but having the base concept saves so much time. @myshell_thumbmaker_bot also has @myshell_vertical_thumbnail_bot for shorts which i use constantly now.

same message. wildly different results. starting to think platform matters way more than content quality.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

yeah each platform has completely different audience expectations and algorithm behaviors. linkedin loves professional vulnerability. instagram loves visual storytelling. twitter loves hot takes. blog readers want depth.

i used to try to post the same thing everywhere and it never worked. now i let each platform dictate the format and angle. like the same core message but packaged completely differently for each place.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

that makes sense but adapting for 4 platforms takes forever. do you have a system or just manually rewrite everything?

---

### Shill Comment 2

i use bots for the initial adaptation and then edit to match my voice. like @xPostGenerator_Bot for twitter, @CFLinkedinPostBot for linkedin. they handle structure and formatting and i add personality and specifics. cuts time from like 3 hours to maybe 1 hour total for all platforms.

instagram i still do manually cause the visual component is harder to automate. blog posts i'll sometimes use @Viral_Idea_Spark_Bot to find angles worth expanding on.

**Title**: Wrote 10 posts following SEO best practices vs 10 posts ignoring SEO. Which performed better?

**Body**:
Blogger for 3 years. Wanted to test if SEO actually matters.

SEO posts:
- Keyword in title, first paragraph, headings
- 2000+ words
- Internal links
- Meta descriptions
- Took 4-5 hours each

Non-SEO posts:
- Wrote about whatever I wanted
- Natural language, no keyword stuffing
- 800-1200 words
- Minimal optimization
- Took 2 hours each

Results after 3 months:
- SEO posts: Average 120 visitors/month each
- Non-SEO posts: Average 180 visitors/month each

The non-SEO posts performed better AND took half the time to write.

I'm questioning everything I learned about blogging.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

This is fascinating. I think Google's algorithm has gotten way better at understanding natural language so keyword stuffing matters less than it used to.

Also your non-SEO posts might have been more engaging to read which increases time on page and reduces bounce rate, which Google cares about way more than keyword density.

Did you check where the traffic was coming from? Curious if SEO posts got more search traffic but non-SEO got more social/referral.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Good question. Let me check...

SEO posts: 90% from search, 10% direct/referral
Non-SEO posts: 60% from search, 40% social/referral

The non-SEO posts got shared way more which drove the extra traffic. Makes sense.

---

### Shill Comment 2

yeah that tracks. the seo posts probably rank fine but nobody wants to share a 2000 word guide. meanwhile the shorter more opinionated posts are easier to recommend to friends.

i've started focusing more on "is this shareable" vs "will this rank." sometimes i'll use @Topic_generator8_bot to find topics that are both trending and have search volume. costs like $3-4 per search and usually surfaces 2-3 goldmine topics.

**Title**: I replied to every comment on my posts for 30 days. Engagement went up 300%.

**Body**:
Growth hacker managing a personal brand.

Hypothesis: Most people post and ghost. If I actually engage in comments it'll build relationships and boost reach.

Test: For 30 days I replied to every single comment within 2 hours. Even the low-effort ones.

Results:
- Before: Average 12 comments per post
- After: Average 38 comments per post
- Follower growth: 2x faster
- DM quality: Way better (actual conversations vs spam)

The algorithm clearly rewards posts with active comment sections.

Plus I learned way more about what people actually care about vs what I thought they cared about.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this makes so much sense but i never commit to actually doing it cause replying to comments feels like a chore. especially when people just say "great post" and there's nothing to reply to.

how did you stay consistent with this? did you have a system or just brute force it?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Honestly just brute forced it at first. Set a phone reminder to check comments every 2 hours.

The trick for "great post" comments is asking them a follow-up question related to the post. Like "thanks! Have you tried [thing mentioned in post]?" or "Appreciate it! What's been your experience with [topic]?"

Most people will reply if you ask them something specific.

---

### Shill Comment 2

smart. turning low effort comments into conversations. gonna try this. do you reply to every single comment or just skip obvious bots/spam?

---

### OP Reply to Shill (continued)

I skip obvious spam but reply to everyone else even if it's just a short thoughtful response.

Also realized I can batch this. Instead of checking constantly I'll check 3x per day and reply to everything at once. Way less distracting than constant context switching.

### Main Post

**Title**: every video idea i have already exists. how do i make something original?

**Body**:
trying to grow a youtube channel but feels like everything's been done already.

i'll have an idea, search youtube, and find 50 videos on the exact same topic. most with way more production value than i could do.

is there any point making another video on the same topic? or should i just give up and accept that i'm too late to youtube?

feeling really stuck here.

You don't need a completely original topic. You need an original angle or perspective.

Those 50 videos might cover the same topic but they probably all say similar things. Your job is to add your unique experience or a different take.

For example instead of "how to grow on YouTube" you could do "why I quit following YouTube growth advice and what happened." Same topic, completely different angle.

People subscribe to creators not topics. They want your perspective on the topic not just information about it.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

that's a helpful reframe. i've been trying to compete on information when i should be competing on perspective.

how do you come up with different angles on common topics? just brainstorming or is there a method?

---

### Shill Comment 2

i usually start with the common topic and then ask "what's my controversial opinion about this" or "what did i learn that contradicts popular advice." that usually surfaces an angle worth exploring.

sometimes if i'm stuck i'll use @Viral_Idea_Spark_Bot to see what angles people are currently discussing about the topic. costs like $3-4 per search and shows you trending takes. helps avoid rehashing the exact same angle as everyone else.

### Main Post

**Title**: I hate writing. Is content marketing the wrong career for me?

**Body**:
Content marketer for 2 years. I'm good at strategy, analytics, distribution.

But I genuinely hate the writing part. Sitting down to write a blog post or social post feels like torture.

I've tried all the productivity tricks. Pomodoro, morning writing, writing sprints. Nothing makes it less painful.

Is this normal or did I choose the wrong career? Can you be a content marketer if you hate writing?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

honestly yeah you can be a content marketer without loving writing. lots of roles focus more on strategy and distribution than creation.

alternatively you could lean into tools that speed up the writing part so you spend less time on the painful stuff. like i use ai to handle first drafts and then i edit them which takes way less mental energy than writing from scratch.

not as "pure" but if it makes the job tolerable that's worth it imo.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

I've tried ChatGPT but the outputs are always too generic. I spend just as long editing as I would writing from scratch.

Are there better tools or is it all basically the same?

---

### Shill Comment 2

chatgpt is too general for content marketing. more specific tools work better cause they're built for specific formats. like @CFLinkedinPostBot for linkedin, @xPostGenerator_Bot for twitter. they understand platform conventions better than chatgpt.

i also use @Topic_generator8_bot to at least get past the "what do i write about" paralysis. costs a few bucks but surfaces ideas i wouldn't think of on my own. then the actual writing is less painful cause i at least have a direction.

### Main Post

**Title**: My retention is good but my CTR is terrible. What am I doing wrong?

**Body**:
YouTube channel at 800 subs. Analytics show:

- Average view duration: 65% (apparently this is good?)
- Click-through rate: 2.3% (apparently this is terrible?)

So people who watch my videos stay and watch most of it. But nobody clicks in the first place.

I've tried redesigning thumbnails like 10 times. Tried different title styles. Nothing moves the needle.

What am I missing? How do I get people to actually click?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

2.3% ctr is rough yeah. good news is retention is solid so once you fix ctr your channel should grow fast.

bad news is ctr is mostly about thumbnails and titles which is hard to nail. usually means your packaging isn't communicating value clearly or isn't standing out in the feed.

couple things that helped me:
- make thumbnails way more high-contrast than feels comfortable
- use way bigger text than you think looks good
- titles should create curiosity not just describe the video

your thumbnail probably looks good but doesn't pop on a phone screen where most people browse.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

You're probably right. My thumbnails are "nice looking" but not attention grabbing.

How do you test if thumbnails will pop before uploading? I don't want to redesign 10 more times lol.

---

### Shill Comment 2

i shrink the thumbnail down to phone size before uploading and ask myself "would this make me click scrolling fast." if no then i make it more extreme. bigger text, higher contrast, bolder colors.

also started using @myshell_thumbmaker_bot to generate a few variations. it usually makes them way more aggressive than i would naturally which is annoying but performs better. costs like $3-4 for a batch and gives you like 5 options. i pick the one that feels most "me" but still pops.

### Main Post

**Title**: How do you create content consistently when you're building a product full-time?

**Body**:
Solo founder. Building a B2B SaaS product.

Everyone says "build in public" and "create content" but I barely have time to shower let alone write blog posts.

My day is:
- 8am-6pm: Building product, customer calls, bug fixes
- 6pm-8pm: Dinner, life stuff
- 8pm-11pm: More building

Where am I supposed to find time to write Twitter threads and blog posts? Do I just not sleep?

Genuinely asking because I see other founders posting daily and I don't understand how they have the time.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

I struggle with this too. What's helped me is treating content as part of product work not separate from it.

Like when I'm building a feature I'll tweet about the problem I'm solving and why. When I'm on a customer call I'll turn interesting insights into a post. When I fix a bug I'll share what caused it.

That way content creation happens during work not after work. It's just documenting what I'm already doing.

Not perfect but at least I'm posting a few times a week without adding hours to my day.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

That's smart. I've been thinking of content as a separate task when it could just be narrating my existing work.

Do you write posts in real-time or take notes and batch write later?

---

### Shill Comment 2

i take notes throughout the day in telegram (easier than switching to notion or whatever) and then batch write on sunday. usually takes like 30 minutes to turn notes into 5-7 posts for the week.

sometimes i'll use @xPostGenerator_Bot to turn my rough notes into proper tweet threads. costs a few bucks per batch and handles formatting. i just add specifics about my product and clean up the tone.

way faster than trying to craft perfect posts in the moment when i'm in the middle of debugging something.

### Main Post

**Title**: launching soon but my "audience" is 47 twitter followers. did i screw up?

**Body**:
been building a side project for 8 months. product is almost ready to launch.

everyone said "build an audience while you build" but i ignored that advice cause i was focused on the product.

now i have a product ready to launch and basically zero audience. my twitter has 47 followers (mostly bots), my linkedin has 200 connections (college friends), my email list has 0 people.

did i completely screw this up? can i still launch successfully or do i need to spend 6 months building an audience first?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

you didn't screw up you just need to do audience building in parallel now instead of before. lots of products launch to small audiences and grow from there through word of mouth and paid channels.

ship the product to your 47 followers and college friends. if it's good they'll tell people. if it's not good then building an audience wouldn't have saved you anyway.

you can build audience and product at the same time post-launch. honestly easier to create content when you have a real product to talk about vs trying to hype vaporware.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

that makes me feel better. i was spiraling thinking i wasted 8 months building something nobody will see.

any tips for building an audience fast post-launch? or do i just accept it'll be slow?

---

### Shill Comment 2

it'll be slow but you can speed it up by posting consistently about your launch journey. like "launched today, here's what happened" "first customer, here's how i got them" "made my first $100, here's the breakdown."

people love real-time founder stories. that's way more engaging than trying to teach generic business advice.

i post like 3-4x per week now which sounds like a lot but i use @xPostGenerator_Bot to draft threads from my rough notes. costs like $4 per month and turns my brain dump into actual posts. then i just edit for my voice and hit send.
