# Differentiated Writing Style Guide for OP vs Shill

## The Problem
When OP and shill comments use the same writing style (all lowercase, same colloquialisms, same structure), it looks like one person wrote everything.

---

## OP Post Style (Main Posts)

### Characteristics:
- **Capitalization**: Mix of proper capitalization and casual lowercase
- **Structure**: Can use bullet points and organized formatting
- **Tone**: Thoughtful, reflective, seeking input
- **Length**: 3-5 paragraphs with clear breaks
- **Colloquialisms**: Moderate use (1-2 per post)

### Example OP Style:
```
Been running social media for 2 brands and honestly feels like I spend more time on admin tasks than actual content creation.

Curious what's eating up the most time for other people here. Is it:
• ideation (coming up with what to post)
• creation (actually making the content)
• distribution (posting across platforms)

trying to figure out if I should optimize my workflow or if everyone's just drowning in the same stuff lol.

## Shill Comment Style 1 (Casual/Lowercase)

### Characteristics:
- **Capitalization**: Mostly lowercase throughout
- **Structure**: NO bullet points, flowing paragraphs
- **Tone**: Conversational, sharing experience casually
- **Length**: 2-3 paragraphs, no hard breaks
- **Colloquialisms**: Heavy use (tbh, ngl, lol, etc.)

### Example Shill Style 1:
```
distribution kills me tbh. i make one youtube video and then i need to manually adapt it for instagram, tiktok, linkedin, twitter. each platform wants different formats, different aspect ratios, different caption styles. the actual video takes 3 hours but adapting it for 4 platforms takes another 3 hours which is ridiculous. tried using some automation tools but most of them are either too expensive or the output is generic garbage. curious if anyone's found something that actually works.
```

## Shill Comment Style 2 (Proper/Structured)

### Characteristics:
- **Capitalization**: Proper capitalization (sentences start with capitals)
- **Structure**: Natural paragraphs, NO bullet points
- **Tone**: More articulate, but still Reddit-casual
- **Length**: 2-4 shorter paragraphs
- **Colloquialisms**: Light use, more professional

### Example Shill Style 2:
```
I've been stuck at 50-100 views per short for like 3 months. Tried everything from better thumbnails to trending sounds to posting times.

Never thought about systematically practicing hooks though. I usually just write one hook per video and call it a day.

Gonna try your 20-per-day thing this week and see what happens. Quick question: did you test these hooks on actual videos or just practice writing them?
```

## Shill Comment Style 3 (Technical/Detailed)

### Characteristics:
- **Capitalization**: Proper capitalization
- **Structure**: Longer paragraphs with natural flow
- **Tone**: More analytical, sharing specific insights
- **Length**: 3-4 medium paragraphs
- **Colloquialisms**: Minimal, professional tone

### Example Shill Style 3:
```
This makes so much sense. Success posts feel like humble brags while failure posts feel like you're inviting people into the struggle.

I run a small agency with 3 clients and I've always been scared to post about failures because I thought it would make me look incompetent. Maybe I should try it.

Did you worry about clients seeing your failure posts and losing trust? That's my main concern with this approach.

## OP Reply Style (Responses to Shills)

### Characteristics:
- **Capitalization**: Match the OP's main post style
- **Structure**: NO bullet points in comments, natural flow
- **Tone**: Helpful, specific, but not salesy
- **Length**: 2-3 paragraphs maximum
- **Bot mentions**: Natural, casual, in context

### Example OP Reply Style:
```
oh yeah this is brutal. i've been testing telegram bots for this actually. there's one called @youtube_clickbait_title_bot that generates like 10 title variations in different styles. saves me from staring at a blank doc for 30 minutes.

the output needs editing maybe 30% of the time cause some suggestions are too generic, but way faster than starting from scratch. costs like $4 for 50 uses or something.

lmk if you want details on how to use it, it's pretty straightforward.
```

## Comment Section Rules

### What NOT to do:
❌ Use bullet points in comments
❌ Break every sentence into a new line
❌ Say "built it with shell agent"
❌ Mention "$25/month for unlimited bots"
❌ Over-structure the response
❌ Make OP and shill sound identical

### What TO do:
✅ Write in flowing paragraphs
✅ Maximum 2-3 paragraph breaks per comment
✅ Vary capitalization style between OP and shill
✅ Mention bots naturally in context
✅ Keep cost mentions vague and casual
✅ Acknowledge limitations naturally

## Style Mixing Strategy

For each post, assign styles:

**Option 1:**
- OP: Proper capitalization, organized
- Shill 1: All lowercase, super casual
- OP Reply: Match OP's main style

**Option 2:**
- OP: Mixed capitalization, casual
- Shill 1: Proper capitalization, structured
- OP Reply: Stay casual like OP

**Option 3:**
- OP: Proper capitalization, detailed
- Shill 1: Lowercase, conversational
- Shill 2: Proper capitalization, technical
- OP Replies: Match OP's style

## Bot Mention Examples (Natural)

### Bad (too salesy):
"Built it with shell agent. Costs $25/month for unlimited bots. Took like an hour to set up."

### Good (natural):
- "there's this bot called @youtube_clickbait_title_bot that helps with titles"
- "i use @Hook_Generator_Bot sometimes, costs like $4 for a bunch of generations"
- "found @myshell_thumbmaker_bot recently, saves time on thumbnails"
- "been testing @xPostGenerator_Bot, works ok but needs editing"

---

## Key Principle

**The OP and shill should feel like different people having a genuine conversation, not one person playing both roles.**

Vary:
- Capitalization style
- Paragraph structure
- Tone/formality
- Colloquialism frequency
- Response length
