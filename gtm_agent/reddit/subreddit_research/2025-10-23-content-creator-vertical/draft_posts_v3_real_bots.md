### Main Post

**Title**: What's your biggest time sink in content creation right now?

**Body**:
Been running social media for 2 brands and honestly feels like I spend more time on admin tasks (titles, captions, formatting) than actual content creation.

Curious what's eating up the most time for other people here. Is it:
• ideation (coming up with what to post)
• creation (actually making the content)
• distribution (posting across platforms)
• or something else I'm not thinking of?

trying to figure out if I should optimize my workflow or if everyone's just drowning in the same stuff lol.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

distribution kills me tbh. i make one youtube video and then i need to manually adapt it for instagram, tiktok, linkedin, twitter. each platform wants different formats, different aspect ratios, different caption styles. the actual video takes 3 hours but adapting it for 4 platforms takes another 3 hours which is ridiculous. tried using some automation tools but most of them are either too expensive or the output is generic garbage. curious if anyone's found something that actually works.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

oh yeah this is brutal. i've been testing a few telegram bots for this actually. found one called @xPostGenerator_Bot that takes a topic and generates twitter threads, and @CFLinkedinPostBot for linkedin posts. both save me like 45 minutes per post compared to writing from scratch.

the output still needs editing maybe 30% of the time cause some suggestions are too generic, but way faster than staring at a blank doc. costs like $4-5 for a bunch of generations.

also been using @Topic_generator8_bot to help with ideation when i'm stuck. lmk if you want details on how i use them in my workflow.

**Title**: What's one thing you wish you knew before starting YouTube?

**Body**:
Been at this for 6 months now (sitting at 400 subs) and man there's so much stuff nobody tells you.

For me it was realizing that titles and thumbnails matter WAY more than video quality. I was spending 8 hours editing videos and 10 minutes on titles. Views were trash.

Flipped it around. Now I spend 2 hours on titles/thumbnails, 4 hours on the actual video. Went from 80 views to 800 views per video.

Curious what you guys wish you knew earlier. Drop it below, might help someone starting out.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

Honestly wish I knew how important the first 3 seconds are.

I was making these long intros with my channel name, music, all that stuff. Thought it looked professional. Turns out nobody cares lol. People click off if you don't hook them immediately.

Started testing different hooks and my retention went from 30% to 65%. Literally just changing the first 10 seconds made that much difference.

Anyone got good resources for learning hook writing? I've been testing randomly but there's gotta be a better way.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Yeah hook optimization is huge. I actually use @Hook_Generator_Bot on telegram now before I record anything. You send it your video topic and it generates like 5-7 hook variations with different angles.

Not perfect (sometimes the suggestions are generic) but it helps me avoid obvious duds before spending hours recording. I think it costs like $4 for 50 generations or something.

What's been working for me is generating 5 hooks, picking the top 2, then combining elements from both into one final hook. Happy to share more if that helps.

**Title**: What's a growth hack you discovered by accident?

**Body**:
Content marketer here managing 3 brands solo.

Accidentally discovered that posting the SAME content on LinkedIn at 7am vs 2pm can change engagement by 300%. Started tracking all my post times and realized each platform has completely different peak hours.

Now I use a scheduler and engagement doubled without changing the actual content.

Curious what accidental discoveries you've made that ended up being huge for growth.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this reminds me of something i found with competitor research. i was spending hours manually going through my competitor's profiles trying to figure out what was working for them, what topics got engagement, what posting patterns they used. super time consuming and probably missed a lot of stuff.

found this bot @X_Rival_Analysis_bot that analyzes competitor twitter accounts and gives you a breakdown of their top performing content, posting frequency, engagement patterns etc. saves like 2 hours per competitor analysis and catches patterns i would've missed. costs like $5 for an analysis report which is way cheaper than the time i was spending.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Damn that's actually really smart. Never thought about automating competitor research like that.

I've been manually checking competitor profiles maybe once a month but it's such a drag. Having a bot pull patterns would be way more consistent.

Does it work for other platforms or just Twitter? I'm trying to track LinkedIn competitors too but manually going through their profiles is painful.

### Main Post

**Title**: Do you guys use AI for anything in your workflow?

**Body**:
Curious how other YouTubers are using AI tools (if at all).

i've tried ChatGPT for scripts but the output always sounds too formal. Tried some thumbnail generators but they look generic.

Only thing that's actually stuck is using it for title brainstorming. I give it my topic and it spits out 20 variations. Saves like 30 minutes of staring at a blank doc.

What are you using AI for that actually works? Not looking for tools that "could" work, want to know what you're actually using daily.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

thumbnails are honestly my biggest struggle. i can edit videos fine but designing thumbnails in canva takes me forever cause i have no design skills lol. i'll spend like an hour just moving text around trying to make it look good and it still ends up mediocre.

tried @myshell_thumbmaker_bot recently and it generates thumbnail concepts based on your video topic. you still need to edit them in canva but having a starting point saves like 40 minutes per thumbnail. costs maybe $3-4 for a batch of thumbnails. also there's @myshell_vertical_thumbnail_bot for shorts which is super helpful.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Wait this is interesting. Does it generate the actual image or just concepts?

I've tried AI thumbnail generators before but they always look too "AI-generated" if that makes sense. Like you can tell it's not made by a human.

How much do you typically have to edit the output to make it look good?

---

### Shill Comment 2

it generates actual images you can use. the style is pretty clean but yeah you can sometimes tell it's ai. i usually change the text style, adjust colors to match my channel branding, maybe swap out the background. takes like 10-15 minutes of editing vs 60 minutes creating from scratch. for me that's worth it cause thumbnails aren't my strong suit anyway.

**Title**: What are you doing about AI search eating your traffic?

**Body**:
Blogger here. Been running a tech blog for 4 years.

Traffic dropped 30% since Google started showing AI summaries. People just read the AI answer and don't click through anymore.

Tried:
• longer posts (didn't help)
• more video content (YouTube algo is brutal)
• newsletter (growth is slow)

Honestly feels like the golden age of blogging is over. Curious what others are doing to adapt.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

Same boat here. Lost 40% traffic over the last 8 months.

What's working for me is pivoting to topics AI can't answer well. Stuff like personal case studies, regional-specific content, opinion pieces. Basically anything that requires lived experience versus just regurgitating facts.

Also started using @Viral_Idea_Spark_Bot to find trending angles in my niche that aren't saturated yet. It scrapes social platforms and suggests post ideas that are currently getting traction. Helps me stay ahead of the AI summary game because I'm writing about stuff that's trending NOW versus generic evergreen content that AI handles well.

Traffic isn't back to where it was but at least it's not dropping anymore.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

The pivoting to experience-based content makes sense. I've noticed my "I tested X for 6 months" posts still get decent traffic while my "What is X" posts are dead.

How often do you use that idea bot? Daily or just when you're planning content?

---

### Shill Comment 2

i run it like 2-3 times a week when i'm planning my content calendar. you give it your niche and it sends back trending discussions and post angles. i'll get maybe 10 ideas and usually 2-3 are actually good. the rest are either too generic or not relevant but those 2-3 good ones are worth it. costs a few bucks per search i think.

**Title**: anyone else feel like they spend more time on youtube admin than actual creating?

**Body**:
been doing youtube for 8 months and i swear i spend more time on titles, tags, descriptions, thumbnails than actually making videos.

filming takes 2 hours. editing takes 3 hours. but then titling, thumbnail, description, tags, posting to community tab, replying to comments takes another 2-3 hours.

feels backwards lol. like i'm a youtube admin not a content creator.

is this normal or am i just slow at this stuff?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

This is totally normal. The "admin" work is actually super important for the algorithm.

I used to rush through titles and descriptions because I thought the video quality was what mattered. Turns out YouTube doesn't know your video is high quality unless your title and description tell the algorithm what the video is about.

Started spending more time on metadata and my impressions went up like 200%. The video content was the same, just better titles and descriptions.

I use @youtube_clickbait_title_bot now to generate title variations and @YouTube_Video_Text_Bot to help with descriptions. Cuts the admin time in half. Worth checking out if you're spending hours on this stuff.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

wait really? i thought the title bot would just make clickbait garbage that doesn't match my content.

how do you use it without making titles that feel fake or misleading?

---

### Shill Comment 2

fair concern. the bot generates different styles so you can pick the tone that matches your content. like it'll give you some clickbait options, some straightforward options, some curiosity-based options. you just pick the style that fits your video and brand. i usually go with the curiosity-based ones cause they get clicks without feeling scammy. still edit them a bit but it's faster than brainstorming from scratch.

### Main Post

**Title**: I wrote 20 hooks every day for a week. Not sure what happened but something clicked.

**Body**:
idk if anyone else here's been stuck in that "why does no one watch my shorts anymore" loop, but I got so frustrated last week that I literally forced myself to write 20 different hooks per day for 7 days straight.

Day 1 was pure cringe ngl. Half of them sounded like a robot trying to sell toothpaste.

But around day 3... I started noticing small patterns:
• verbs that feel emotional (like "imagine", "remember", "ever felt like...")
• numbers that create pressure instead of info ("3 mistakes you don't notice until it's too late")
• not saying "you" too early, makes it sound less clickbait-y somehow

By day 7, I could almost tell within 2 seconds if something would flop or not. It's like my brain started predicting attention. idk how else to explain it lol.

anyway, just wanted to drop this here in case someone's stuck in the same spot. Not selling anything, just been testing this framework and it helped me a lot. Happy to share more if anyone wants.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is actually really interesting. i've been stuck at 50-100 views per short for like 3 months now. tried everything from better thumbnails to trending sounds to posting at different times. never thought about systematically practicing hooks though. i usually just write one hook per video and call it a day. gonna try your 20-per-day thing this week and see what happens. quick question: did you test these hooks on actual videos or just practice writing them first?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Started with just writing (no videos) for the first 3 days to build the muscle memory.

Then on day 4 I started testing the best 3 hooks from each day on actual shorts. Posted 3 shorts per day for 4 days. Noticed that my "day 7 hooks" got 3x more views than my "day 4 hooks" even though the video content was basically the same.

Also been using @Hook_Generator_Bot to speed up the testing. You send it your video topic and it generates hooks with different angles. Way faster than waiting 24 hours to see if your hook flopped. I think it costs like $4 for 50 generations.

Not saying it's magic but it definitely helped me avoid obvious duds before recording. The practice still matters more than the tool though.

### Main Post

**Title**: Been tracking my post performance for 6 months. Found a pattern I didn't expect.

**Body**:
Content marketer managing 2 brands (SaaS + ecommerce).

Started tracking every single post I made in a spreadsheet: time posted, platform, format, engagement, conversions.

After 6 months (300+ posts), noticed something weird:

Posts where I shared a FAILURE got 2x more engagement than posts where I shared a SUCCESS.

Examples:
• "we spent $5k on influencer marketing and got 2 sales" - 45 comments, 12 DMs
• "we hit $10k MRR in 3 months" - 8 comments, 1 DM

People love seeing behind-the-scenes struggles way more than polished wins.

Now I mix 60% failure posts, 40% success posts. Engagement went up 150% and DM quality improved (people asking genuine questions vs "congrats bro").

Curious if anyone else has noticed this or if my audience is just weird lol.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

This makes so much sense honestly.

Success posts feel like humble brags. Failure posts feel like you're inviting people into the struggle, which is way more relatable.

I run a small agency with 3 clients and I've always been scared to post about failures because I thought it would make me look incompetent.

Maybe I should try it. Did you worry about clients seeing your failure posts and losing trust?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Yeah I was worried about that at first.

The trick is framing failures as LEARNINGS not incompetence. Bad framing: "we wasted $5k on a failed campaign" vs Good framing: "we spent $5k testing influencer marketing, here's the 3 mistakes we made so you don't have to."

Clients have never complained. If anything they appreciate the transparency.

I actually started using @CFLinkedinPostBot to help draft these kinds of posts. You give it your story/data and it generates a few post variations. Then I pick the one with the best framing and edit it to sound more like me. Saves time on the initial draft.

### Main Post

**Title**: Spent 3 months analyzing my YouTube analytics. Here's what actually mattered.

**Body**:
Small YouTuber here (1.2k subs).

Tracked EVERYTHING for 3 months: titles, thumbnails, video length, posting time, topics, hooks, etc. Wanted to see what actually moves the needle.

Results were surprising:
• thumbnails: +5% CTR improvement
• posting time: +2% CTR improvement
• video length: no difference
• titles: +40% CTR improvement

Spent so much time on thumbnails (2 hours per video) when titles had 8x more impact.

Now I spend:
• 1 hour on titles (testing 20+ variations)
• 30 minutes on thumbnails (good enough is fine)

Went from 200 views per video to 800 views per video in 6 weeks.

Moral: track your own data, don't trust what "YouTube gurus" say works.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

wait so you're saying thumbnails don't matter that much? every youtube tutorial i've watched says thumbnails are the most important thing. how did you test titles vs thumbnails to figure this out?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Thumbnails still matter but titles matter MORE (at least for my channel).

Tested it by posting 10 videos with "great thumbnails, mediocre titles" (2 hours on thumb, 10 min on title) vs 10 videos with "mediocre thumbnails, great titles" (30 min on thumb, 1 hour on title).

Great title videos got 3x more impressions from search and browse features. Makes sense: YouTube shows your title in search results, sidebar, notifications. Thumbnail is only visible in some places.

Been using @youtube_clickbait_title_bot to speed up title generation now. You send it your video topic and it generates 10 variations in different styles. Costs like $4 for 50 uses. Way faster than brainstorming manually.

Thumbnails I just use Canva templates now. Good enough.

**Title**: noticed something about automation tools nobody talks about

**Body**:
been testing different automation tools for content workflow over the last 6 months.

tried zapier, make.com, n8n, and some telegram bots.

everyone focuses on FEATURES (what can the tool do) but nobody talks about FRICTION (how annoying is it to use).

examples:
• zapier can do everything but setting up a zap takes 30 minutes and I need to click through 10 screens
• telegram bots are limited in features but I can trigger them in 5 seconds without leaving telegram

realized i was choosing tools based on "can it do X?" when i should've been asking "will i actually use it daily?"

now i prioritize:
1. speed (can i trigger it in <10 seconds?)
2. friction (do i need to switch apps?)
3. features (does it solve my problem?)

switched to telegram bots for 80% of my workflow. Way less powerful than zapier but I actually use them daily. Engagement went from 2 hours/day on tools to 15 minutes/day cause the friction disappeared.

curious if anyone else has noticed this tradeoff.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

This is so real.

I bought so many SaaS tools that I never used because logging in and navigating to the tool was annoying. Meanwhile I use Telegram every 5 minutes so if something lives there I'll actually use it.

What telegram bots are you using? Curious what you replaced with them and if they're actually capable enough for real workflows.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

main ones i use daily:

@xPostGenerator_Bot for generating twitter threads when i have a topic idea. way faster than opening a doc and brainstorming. @myshell_thumbmaker_bot for thumbnail concepts. @Topic_generator8_bot when i need content ideas.

they're not perfect. like i still edit 30-40% of the outputs cause some are generic. But friction is basically zero so i actually use them vs my zapier workflows that i set up once and never touched again.

for me the "will i use it daily" test matters more than "can it do everything i might need someday."

# EXPERIMENT/TEST POSTS

### Main Post

**Title**: Ran an experiment: AI copy vs human copy. Results surprised me.

**Body**:
Content marketer here. Been seeing a lot of debate about AI copywriting so I decided to test it properly.

Test setup:
• Wrote 10 LinkedIn posts manually (15-20 min each)
• Generated 10 LinkedIn posts with AI (2-3 min each)
• Posted them over 4 weeks (mixed randomly)

Results after 4 weeks:
• Human posts: avg 850 impressions, 24 likes, 3 comments
• AI posts: avg 620 impressions, 18 likes, 1 comment

Human copy won but not by as much as I expected.

Interesting finding: when I spent 10 minutes editing AI copy it performed just as well as human copy but took 60% less time.

New workflow:
1. Generate 3 variations with AI (5 minutes)
2. Pick best one and edit for voice/specificity (10 minutes)
3. Post

Saves 5-10 minutes per post. Not revolutionary but adds up (10 hours/month saved).

Curious if others have tested this. What were your results?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is pretty much my workflow now. i use @CFLinkedinPostBot to generate a few drafts, then i edit the best one to match my voice and add specific examples from my work. the bot gives me the structure and angle but i add the personality and specifics. takes like 12 minutes total vs 25 minutes writing from scratch. the time savings are real if you do this daily. costs like $3-4 per month if you use it regularly.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Yeah exactly. The bots are good at structure and angle but terrible at specifics and personality.

I've found that AI copy performs worst when it's too generic. Like "increase your productivity" vs "I saved 4 hours last week by doing X specific thing."

The editing step where you add specific examples and personal voice is what makes the difference. But having that initial structure saves so much time staring at a blank page.

Do you use similar workflow for other platforms or just LinkedIn?

---

### Shill Comment 2

mostly linkedin and twitter. for twitter i use @xPostGenerator_Bot which is pretty similar workflow. generates thread structures and i edit for specifics. tried using ai for instagram captions but those need way more editing cause the tone is super important for ig. linkedin and twitter are more forgiving.

### Main Post

**Title**: Tested posting shorts at different times for 30 days. Data doesn't lie.

**Body**:
saw a bunch of conflicting advice about "best time to post shorts" so i decided to test it myself.

Test: posted 1 short per day for 30 days, rotating through 6 different time slots (7am, 10am, 1pm, 4pm, 7pm, 10pm).

Results:
• 7pm: avg 1,200 views
• 10pm: avg 950 views
• 7am: avg 420 views
• 1pm: avg 380 views
• 10am: avg 320 views
• 4pm: avg 280 views

7pm crushed everything else. Literally 3x more views than posting at 4pm.

But here's the interesting part: the "7pm bump" only lasted 2 weeks. Then it dropped to 600 views.

Think YouTube caught on that I was gaming the algorithm and throttled it lol.

New strategy: mix up posting times so it looks more natural.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

This is super helpful. Been posting randomly and wondering why some videos blow up and others flop.

How'd you track all this data though? Did you use a spreadsheet or some tool? Manually logging into YouTube Studio every day sounds tedious.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Started with a spreadsheet but yeah it was annoying to update manually.

Been looking for a way to automate it but haven't found a good solution yet. YouTube Studio app sends notifications but tracking the data over time in a spreadsheet still requires manual entry.

If anyone knows a bot or tool that pulls YT analytics automatically lmk. Would save a lot of time.

### Main Post

**Title**: tested 3 different b-roll strategies. one made a huge difference.

**Body**:
been making youtube videos for a year and always struggled with b-roll.

either i spent 2 hours finding stock footage (boring) or i just didn't use b-roll (video looked cheap).

decided to test 3 strategies for 20 videos:

strategy 1: no b-roll, just talking head (fast but looked low effort)
strategy 2: stock footage from pexels (took forever to find relevant clips)
strategy 3: screen recordings + simple animations (canva, capcut effects)

results:
- no b-roll: 35% avg retention
- stock footage: 42% avg retention, but took 2 hours per video
- screen recordings + animations: 58% avg retention, took 45 mins per video

the screen recording strategy crushed it. viewers stayed way longer cause the visuals were actually relevant to what i was saying vs generic stock footage.

now i just screen record whatever i'm talking about (websites, apps, documents) and add simple zoom effects. Way easier and performs better.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is smart. i've been using stock footage cause i thought it looked more professional but you're right it takes forever to find relevant clips and most of the time they're only somewhat related to what i'm saying. screen recordings would be way faster and more relevant. do you plan out your b-roll shots before recording or just figure it out during editing?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

i used to plan during scripting but honestly that took too long. now i just record my a-roll first, then during editing when i need b-roll i quickly screen record whatever i'm talking about in that moment. takes like 5 minutes vs 30 minutes searching stock sites.

someone told me about @BRoll_Generator_Bot which analyzes your script and suggests b-roll ideas. haven't tried it yet but might test it. could be useful for planning ahead if you don't want to do everything during editing.

**Title**: Tested repurposing 1 video into 10 pieces of content. Here's what worked.

**Body**:
Content creator managing a personal brand. Wanted to test how much mileage I could get from one piece of content.

Made 1 YouTube video (15 minutes), then repurposed it into:
• 5 Twitter threads
• 3 LinkedIn posts
• 10 Instagram carousels
• 5 TikTok clips
• 1 blog post

Time spent:
• Original video: 8 hours (scripting, filming, editing)
• Repurposing: 6 hours (adapting for each platform)

Results over 2 weeks:
• YouTube video: 2,400 views
• Twitter threads: combined 15,000 impressions
• LinkedIn posts: combined 8,000 impressions
• Instagram carousels: combined 12,000 reach
• TikTok clips: combined 45,000 views
• Blog post: 180 visitors

Total reach: ~82,000 vs 2,400 if I had just posted the YouTube video.

Biggest learning: the repurposed content got 30x more total reach than the original video. Time spent repurposing was worth it.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

This is interesting. I've always heard about repurposing but 6 hours seems like a lot of time. What took the longest during the repurposing process?

I make one YouTube video per week and barely have time to post it to YouTube, let alone 5 other platforms. Curious how you sped through the adaptation part.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

Writing the platform-specific captions took the longest. Each platform has a different tone and format so I was basically rewriting the same ideas 20+ times.

I started using @xPostGenerator_Bot for Twitter threads and @CFLinkedinPostBot for LinkedIn posts which cut the time down. You give it your video topic or transcript and it generates drafts you can edit. Saved maybe 2-3 hours of the repurposing time.

Still not fast enough to do weekly but I'm trying to get the repurposing process down to 3-4 hours so I can do it consistently.

• trending topics (copied what's working in my niche)
• posting consistently (2x per week for 6 months)

nothing's moving the needle.

is there something i'm fundamentally missing or do i just need to keep grinding?

starting to feel like i'm doing something wrong but can't figure out what.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

Had the same problem at 1k subs for like 4 months.

For me it was titles. I was using "descriptive" titles like "How to edit videos in Premiere Pro" when I should've been using "curiosity" titles like "This Premiere Pro trick tripled my editing speed."

Switched to curiosity-focused titles and subs went from 1k to 3k in 2 months. The videos were literally the same content, just different titles that made people more curious to click.

Have you tested different title styles? Your thumbnails might be fine but if your titles aren't compelling people won't click even if they see your video in their feed.

wait that's interesting. i've been doing descriptive titles cause i thought they were better for seo.

how do you come up with curiosity titles? just brainstorming or is there a method?

i use @youtube_clickbait_title_bot honestly. it generates different styles (descriptive, curiosity, hybrid) and you pick the one that fits your content. costs like $4 for 50 generations. way faster than brainstorming for 30 minutes and the curiosity-style titles it generates are pretty good. i still edit them a bit but it gives me a solid starting point. also helps you see patterns in what makes a title curiosity-driven vs just descriptive.

### Main Post

**Title**: Struggling to keep content consistent across platforms. Any tips?

**Body**:
Content marketer here managing 1 brand (SaaS).

Been posting on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, blog.

Problem: every platform wants different formats/styles and I can't keep up.

• LinkedIn wants professional long-form posts
• Twitter wants short punchy threads
• Instagram wants visual storytelling
• Blog wants SEO-optimized articles

I end up either:
1. Posting same content everywhere (low engagement)
2. Customizing for each platform (takes forever)

How do you handle this? Is there a middle ground I'm missing?

tbh i gave up trying to customize everything manually cause it was taking like 8 hours per week just adapting content. what worked for me was creating one master piece (usually a blog post or video) and then using bots to adapt it for each platform as a starting draft. i use @xPostGenerator_Bot for twitter, @CFLinkedinPostBot for linkedin, and manually do instagram cause the visual part is hard to automate. the bots give me like 70% of the way there and i edit the last 30% to match brand voice. cuts time from 8 hours to maybe 3 hours per week.

### OP Reply to Shill

That makes sense. I've been trying to write everything from scratch for each platform which is why it takes forever.

Starting with AI drafts and editing them sounds way more efficient. Do the outputs need heavy editing or are they usually pretty close to what you want?

---

### Shill Comment 2

depends on the platform. twitter drafts usually need light editing (maybe 10-15 mins). linkedin drafts need more work cause the tone has to be more professional (maybe 20-25 mins of editing). instagram i basically just use the bots for caption ideas and do everything else manually. but even with editing its way faster than staring at a blank doc trying to figure out what to write.

### Main Post

**Title**: How do you guys come up with video ideas consistently?

**Body**:
Been making videos for 6 months and the hardest part isn't filming or editing, it's figuring out WHAT to make videos about.

I'll sit there for an hour scrolling through my niche trying to find inspiration and come up with nothing. Then I scramble and make a mediocre video just to hit my upload schedule.

How do you guys ideate consistently? Do you have a system or just wing it?

Starting to feel like I'm the only one struggling with this lol.

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

nah you're not alone i struggle with this too. what kinda helps is keeping a running list in my notes app. whenever i see an interesting topic on reddit, twitter, youtube comments, i add it to the list. then when i need ideas i check the list instead of starting from zero.

still not perfect cause sometimes the list is empty or the ideas on there don't feel inspiring anymore. been thinking about using one of those topic generator bots to help fill the list when i'm stuck. @Topic_generator8_bot or @Viral_Idea_Spark_Bot. haven't tried them yet but might be worth testing.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

The running list idea is good. I've tried that before but I'm bad at actually writing things down in the moment.

What do those bots do exactly? Do they just generate random ideas or are they based on what's trending?

---

### Shill Comment 2

from what i understand they analyze trending content in your niche and suggest ideas based on what's getting traction right now. so it's not random, it's based on actual data of what people are engaging with. i haven't used them personally but a few people in content creator groups i'm in have mentioned them. costs a few bucks per search i think. might be useful if you're consistently stuck on ideation.
