# OPEN DISCUSSION POSTS (6 posts - 30%)

## Post 1: r/GrowthHacking - Discussion

### Main Post

**Title**: what's your biggest time sink in content creation rn?

**Body**:
been running social media for 2 brands and honestly feels like i spend more time on admin tasks (titles, captions, formatting) than actual content creation.

curious what's eating up the most time for other people here. is it:
· ideation (coming up with what to post)
· creation (actually making the content)
· distribution (posting across platforms)
· or something else i'm not thinking of?

trying to figure out if i should optimize my workflow or if everyone's just drowning in the same stuff lol.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

distribution kills me tbh.

i make one youtube video and then i need to manually adapt it for instagram, tiktok, linkedin, twitter. each platform wants different formats, different aspect ratios, different caption styles.

the actual video takes 3 hours. adapting it for 4 platforms takes another 3 hours. it's ridiculous.

tried using some automation tools but most of them are either too expensive or the output is generic garbage. curious if anyone's found something that actually works.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

oh yeah this is brutal. i've been testing telegram bots for this actually.

built 3 that help with the distribution grind:
· content repurposer (@ShellAgent_Repurpose) - feed it a youtube url and it generates platform-specific posts for ig/tiktok/linkedin/twitter
· caption generator (@ShellAgent_CaptionBot) - takes your topic and spits out 5 caption variations per platform
· hashtag suggester (@ShellAgent_HashtagGen) - analyzes your content and suggests relevant hashtags

the repurposer bot saves me like 2-3 hours per video. output still needs editing (maybe 20% of suggestions are off) but way faster than starting from scratch.

built them all using shell agent. costs $25/month for unlimited bots. took like an hour to set up.

lmk if you want details on how i trained them on my brand voice.

## Post 2: r/NewTubers - Discussion

### Main Post

**Title**: what's one thing you wish you knew before starting youtube?

**Body**:
been at this for 6 months now (sitting at 400 subs) and man there's so much stuff nobody tells you.

for me it was realizing that titles and thumbnails matter WAY more than video quality. i was spending 8 hours editing videos and 10 minutes on titles. views were trash.

flipped it around. now i spend 2 hours on titles/thumbnails, 4 hours on the actual video. went from 80 views to 800 views per video.

curious what you guys wish you knew earlier. drop it below, might help someone starting out.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

honestly wish i knew how important the first 3 seconds are.

i was making these long intros with my channel name, music, all that stuff. thought it looked professional.

turns out nobody cares lol. people click off if you don't hook them immediately.

started testing different hooks and my retention went from 30% to 65%. literally just changing the first 10 seconds.

btw anyone got good resources for learning hook writing? i've been testing randomly but there's gotta be a better way.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

yeah hook optimization is huge. i use a telegram bot (@HookAnalyzer) that scores my hooks 1-100 before i record.

you send it your hook script and it tells you:
· curiosity score (does it make people want to watch)
· pattern interrupt (is it surprising enough)
· clarity score (is it confusing or clear)

then it suggests 3 rewritten versions with explanations.

not perfect (sometimes the suggestions are generic) but way better than guessing. costs like $4 to test 50 hooks.

built it using shell agent in about 30 minutes. happy to share the exact prompt i used if you want to build your own.

---

## Post 3: r/ContentMarketing - Discussion

### Main Post

**Title**: what's a growth hack you discovered by accident?

**Body**:
content marketer here managing 3 brands solo.

accidentally discovered that posting the SAME content on linkedin at 7am vs 2pm can change engagement by 300%. started tracking all my post times and realized each platform has completely different peak hours.

now i use a scheduler and engagement doubled without changing the actual content.

curious what accidental discoveries you've made that ended up being huge for growth.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this reminds me of something i found with repurposing content.

i was manually adapting my youtube videos for different platforms and doing it all at once (right after posting the youtube video).

one day i was busy and posted the linkedin version 3 days later. it got 5x more engagement than usual.

turns out linkedin's algorithm favors "fresh" native content over stuff that was already posted elsewhere. so now i stagger my repurposing by 2-3 days per platform.

went from 200 impressions per post to 1000+ just by changing timing.

anyone else notice weird timing patterns like this?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

damn that's actually really smart. never thought about staggering repurposing.

i've been using a content repurpose bot (@ShellAgent_Repurpose) that generates all the platform variations at once but i was posting them same-day.

gonna try your 2-3 day stagger strategy and see if it changes anything.

the bot takes a youtube url and generates:
· 5 instagram carousel scripts
· 3 tiktok hooks
· twitter thread (8-12 tweets)
· linkedin post (1300 char)
· email newsletter draft

costs $25/month. built it with shell agent. takes about 60 seconds to process a 15-minute video.

tbh i still edit like 30% of the outputs cause some are generic but it's way faster than writing from scratch.

if you try the stagger thing lmk how it goes. might be a game changer.

---

## Post 4: r/YouTubers - Discussion

### Main Post

**Title**: do you guys use AI for anything in your workflow?

**Body**:
curious how other youtubers are using ai tools (if at all).

i've tried chatgpt for scripts but the output always sounds too formal. tried some thumbnail generators but they look generic.

only thing that's actually stuck is using it for title brainstorming. i give it my topic and it spits out 20 variations. saves like 30 minutes of staring at a blank doc.

what are you using ai for that actually works? not looking for tools that "could" work, want to know what you're actually using daily.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

i use ai for metadata (titles, descriptions, tags) but had to build custom stuff cause chatgpt was too generic.

made a telegram bot that takes my youtube url after i upload (set to unlisted) and generates:
· 10 title variations with click-worthy scores
· full description with timestamps
· 25 seo-optimized tags
· 5 thumbnail text concepts

took like 2 weeks to train it on my channel's style by feeding it my top 20 videos. now the output actually sounds like me.

saves about 45 minutes per video. i still tweak stuff but it's way better than starting from scratch.

chatgpt alone was trash for this cause it has no context about what works for YOUR channel specifically.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

yo this sounds exactly what i need. how'd you train it on your channel style?

i've been copy-pasting my old titles into chatgpt as "examples" but it's annoying and the output is still hit or miss.

---

### Shill Comment 2

i used shell agent (it's a telegram bot builder). basically you describe what you want and it builds the bot in like 10 minutes.

for training i did:
1. grabbed my top 20 video titles from youtube studio
2. pasted them into the bot setup with a note like "these are my high performing titles, match this style"
3. bot now references those when generating new titles

my bot is @YT_MetadataBot if you wanna test it. costs $4 for 50 generations.

you can also build your own with shell agent for $25/month (unlimited bots). took me maybe an hour to set up.

happy to share screenshots of my exact setup if that helps.

---

## Post 5: r/Podcasting - Discussion

### Main Post

**Title**: how do you handle show notes?

**Body**:
podcaster here, been at it for 2 years (80 episodes).

show notes are the bane of my existence. recording the episode is fun, editing is fine, but writing show notes feels like homework.

tried hiring a va but they don't capture the vibe right. tried ai but it's too generic.

curious how you all handle this. do you even bother with detailed show notes or just wing it?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

i feel this so hard.

i was spending 40 minutes per episode writing show notes. for a 1-hour podcast that i record weekly, that's like 3 hours a month just on show notes.

started using a bot that transcribes the episode and generates:
· episode summary (2-3 sentences)
· key topics discussed (bullet points)
· notable quotes from the episode
· timestamps for main segments

saves me like 30 minutes per episode. i still edit it cause some timestamps are off by a minute but way better than writing from scratch.

costs $25/month. built it with shell agent in telegram.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

wait this is exactly what i need. what's the bot called?

does it work with video podcasts or just audio?

---

### Shill Comment 2

it's @PodcastShowNotesBot. works with both audio and video (just send the file or youtube link).

processing takes like 2-3 minutes for a 1-hour episode.

you can also build your own with shell agent if you want to customize the output format. i tweaked mine to match my show notes style.

shell agent costs $25/month for unlimited bots. took maybe 45 minutes to set up.

lmk if you try it.

---

## Post 6: r/Blogging - Discussion

### Main Post

**Title**: what are you doing about ai search eating your traffic?

**Body**:
blogger here. been running a tech blog for 4 years.

traffic dropped 30% since google started showing ai summaries. people just read the ai answer and don't click through anymore.

tried:
· longer posts (didn't help)
· more video content (youtube algo is brutal)
· newsletter (growth is slow)

honestly feels like the golden age of blogging is over. curious what others are doing to adapt.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

same boat. lost 40% traffic over the last 8 months.

what's working for me is pivoting to topics ai can't answer. stuff like:
· personal case studies ("i tested X for 6 months, here's what happened")
· regional-specific content (local laws, regulations)
· opinion pieces (ai can't have opinions... yet lol)

basically anything that requires lived experience vs just facts.

also started a telegram bot that scrapes reddit/twitter for trending topics in my niche and suggests post ideas that are currently blowing up. helps me stay ahead of ai summaries.

traffic isn't back to where it was but at least it's not dropping anymore.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

the trending topics bot sounds interesting. how's that work?

i've been manually checking reddit but it's time consuming.

---

### Shill Comment 2

it's a telegram bot (@TrendTopicBot) that runs every morning.

it scrapes specific subreddits and twitter hashtags i tell it to monitor, then sends me a daily digest with:
· top 3 trending discussions
· suggested blog post angles
· estimated search volume for the topic

costs $4/month. built it with shell agent in like 20 minutes.

you can customize which sources it monitors and how often it checks.

also helps avoid writing posts about stuff that's already saturated.

# OBSERVATION/DISCOVERY POSTS (5 posts - 25%)

## Post 7: r/NewTubers - Observation

### Main Post

**Title**: i wrote 20 hooks every day for a week. not sure what happened but something clicked.

**Body**:
idk if anyone else here's been stuck in that "why does no one watch my shorts anymore" loop, but i got so frustrated last week that i literally forced myself to write 20 different hooks per day for 7 days straight.

day 1 was pure cringe ngl. half of them sounded like a robot trying to sell toothpaste.

but around day 3... i started noticing small stuff that weirdly worked:
1. verbs that feel emotional (like "imagine", "remember", "ever felt like...")
2. numbers that create pressure instead of info ("3 mistakes you don't notice until it's too late")
3. and not saying "you" too early. makes it sound less clickbait-y somehow

by day 7, i could almost tell within 2 seconds if something would flop or not. it's like my brain started predicting attention. idk how else to explain it lol.

anyway, just wanted to drop this here in case someone's stuck in the same spot. not selling anything, just been testing a small framework that helped me a lot. happy to share it if anyone wants.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is actually really interesting.

i've been stuck at 50-100 views per short for like 3 months. tried everything (better thumbnails, trending sounds, posting times).

never thought about systematically practicing hooks. i usually just write one hook per video and call it a day.

gonna try your 20-per-day thing this week and see what happens.

quick question: did you test these hooks on actual videos or just practice writing them?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

started with just writing (no videos) for the first 3 days.

then on day 4 i started testing the best 3 hooks from each day on actual shorts. posted 3 shorts per day for 4 days.

noticed that my "day 7 hooks" got 3x more views than my "day 4 hooks" even though the video content was similar.

also built a telegram bot (@HookAnalyzer) that scores hooks 1-100 to speed up the testing process. way faster than posting and waiting 24 hours to see if it flopped.

costs $4 for 50 hook analyses. built it with shell agent in like 30 minutes.

not saying it's magic but it def helped me avoid obvious duds before recording.

---

## Post 8: r/ContentMarketing - Observation

### Main Post

**Title**: been tracking my post performance for 6 months. found a pattern i didn't expect.

**Body**:
content marketer managing 2 brands (saas + ecommerce).

started tracking every single post i made in a spreadsheet: time posted, platform, format, engagement, conversions.

after 6 months (300+ posts), noticed something weird:

posts where i shared a FAILURE got 2x more engagement than posts where i shared a SUCCESS.

examples:
· "we spent $5k on influencer marketing and got 2 sales" - 45 comments, 12 DMs
· "we hit $10k mrr in 3 months" - 8 comments, 1 DM

people love seeing behind-the-scenes struggles way more than polished wins.

now i mix 60% failure posts, 40% success posts. engagement went up 150% and dm quality improved (people asking genuine questions vs "congrats bro").

curious if anyone else has noticed this or if my audience is just weird lol.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this makes so much sense tbh.

success posts feel like humble brags. failure posts feel like you're inviting people into the struggle.

i run a small agency (3 clients) and i've always been scared to post about failures cause i thought it'd make me look incompetent.

maybe i should try it.

did you worry about clients seeing your failure posts and losing trust?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

yeah i was worried about that at first.

trick is to frame failures as LEARNINGS not incompetence.

bad framing: "we wasted $5k on a failed campaign"
good framing: "we spent $5k testing influencer marketing. here's the 3 mistakes we made so you don't have to"

also i built a telegram bot (@PostFrameBot) that takes my draft posts and suggests 3 reframes (failure → learning, success → humble, etc).

saves me from overthinking. costs $4 for 50 reframes. built it with shell agent.

clients have never complained. if anything they appreciate the transparency.

---

## Post 9: r/GrowthHacking - Observation

### Main Post

**Title**: noticed something about automation tools nobody talks about.

**Body**:
been testing different automation tools for content workflow over the last 6 months.

tried zapier, make.com, n8n, and some telegram bots.

everyone focuses on FEATURES (what can the tool do) but nobody talks about FRICTION (how annoying is it to use).

examples:
· zapier can do everything but setting up a zap takes 30 minutes and i need to click through 10 screens
· telegram bots are limited in features but i can trigger them in 5 seconds without leaving telegram

realized i was choosing tools based on "can it do X?" when i should've been asking "will i actually use it daily?"

now i prioritize:
1. speed (can i trigger it in <10 seconds?)
2. friction (do i need to switch apps?)
3. features (does it solve my problem?)

switched to telegram bots for 80% of my workflow. way less powerful than zapier but i actually use them daily.

engagement went from 2 hours/day on tools to 15 minutes/day cause the friction disappeared.

curious if anyone else has noticed this tradeoff.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is so real.

i bought so many saas tools that i never used cause logging in and navigating to the tool was annoying.

meanwhile i use telegram every 5 minutes so if something lives there i'll actually use it.

what telegram bots are you using? curious what you replaced with them.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

main ones i use daily:
· @ShellAgent_CaptionBot - generate 5 caption variations for a topic
· @ShellAgent_Repurpose - turn 1 youtube video into 10 posts
· @YT_TitleBot - generate 10 title variations for youtube

all built with shell agent (telegram bot builder). costs $25/month for unlimited bots.

friction is basically zero. i just open telegram, send a message, get results in 30-60 seconds.

tried doing the same stuff with zapier but the setup was so complicated i never finished it lol.

not saying telegram bots replace everything (i still use google sheets for analytics) but for daily repetitive tasks they're way better.

---

## Post 10: r/YouTubers - Observation

### Main Post

**Title**: spent 3 months analyzing my youtube analytics. here's what actually mattered.

**Body**:
small youtuber here (1.2k subs).

tracked EVERYTHING for 3 months: titles, thumbnails, video length, posting time, topics, hooks, etc.

wanted to see what actually moves the needle.

results were surprising:
· thumbnails: +5% ctr improvement
· posting time: +2% ctr improvement
· video length: no difference
· titles: +40% ctr improvement

spent so much time on thumbnails (2 hours per video) when titles had 8x more impact.

now i spend:
· 1 hour on titles (testing 20+ variations)
· 30 minutes on thumbnails (good enough is fine)

went from 200 views per video to 800 views per video in 6 weeks.

moral: track your own data, don't trust what "youtube gurus" say works.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

wait so you're saying thumbnails don't matter that much?

every youtube tutorial i've watched says thumbnails are the most important thing.

how did you test titles vs thumbnails?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

thumbnails still matter but titles matter MORE (at least for my channel).

tested it by:
1. posting 10 videos with "great thumbnails, mediocre titles" (2 hours on thumb, 10 min on title)
2. posting 10 videos with "mediocre thumbnails, great titles" (30 min on thumb, 1 hour on title)

great title videos got 3x more impressions from search and browse features.

makes sense: youtube shows your title in search results, sidebar, notifications. thumbnail is only visible in some places.

also built a telegram bot (@YT_TitleBot) that generates 10 title variations with ctr scores. way faster than brainstorming manually.

costs $4 for 50 title generations. built it with shell agent.

thumbnails i just use canva templates now. good enough.

---

## Post 11: r/Podcasting - Observation

### Main Post

**Title**: been podcasting for 2 years. finally figured out what makes people listen to the end.

**Body**:
hit 100 episodes last month. went back and analyzed every episode to see what made people listen all the way through vs dropping off.

findings:
· long intros = instant dropoff (lost 40% of listeners in first 5 minutes)
· "on today's episode..." teasers = kept 80% of listeners through intro
· bringing up controversial opinion in first 3 minutes = 90% retention

basically: hook them FAST or they're gone.

i used to do 5-minute intros with my theme song, sponsor read, personal updates. retention was trash (30% average).

now i do:
· 30-second teaser of the most interesting moment from the episode
· straight into the conversation
· intro stuff at the end

retention went from 30% to 65% in 8 weeks.

crazy how small changes make huge differences.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this makes sense. i've been doing long intros cause i thought it was "professional".

how did you figure out which moments were interesting enough to use as teasers?

i feel like i'd pick the wrong moments lol.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

honestly just trial and error at first.

then i built a telegram bot (@PodcastClipperBot) that listens to the full episode and suggests 5 "high energy" moments to use as teasers.

it analyzes:
· tone changes (when you get excited or intense)
· controversial statements
· laugh moments
· surprising facts or stats

costs $4 per episode. built it with shell agent in like 40 minutes.

not perfect (sometimes it picks boring moments lol) but right like 70% of the time. way better than guessing.

# EXPERIMENT/TEST POSTS (4 posts - 20%)

## Post 12: r/GrowthHacking - Experiment

### Main Post

**Title**: tested 3 different telegram bots for content workflow. one clear winner.

**Body**:
been managing content for 2 brands solo and was drowning in repetitive tasks.

decided to test automating some stuff with telegram bots since i basically live in telegram anyway.

tested 3 bots over the last month:
1. caption generator - input topic, get 5 caption variations
2. content repurposer - upload video, get posts for different platforms
3. trend monitor - scrapes reddit/twitter for trending topics

the content repurposer was the clear winner for me. saves like 8 hours/week.

caption generator was ok but outputs felt generic (had to edit 50% of them). trend monitor was useful but i could manually do that faster.

anyway just thought i'd share in case anyone else is in the same boat. not affiliated with any of these just documenting my test.

happy to answer questions if anyone's curious about specific workflows or how i set them up.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

ok this is actually pretty relevant to what i've been dealing with lately.

i run a small youtube channel (500 subs) and the biggest time sink for me is honestly just coming up with titles and thumbnails. i'll spend like 30 minutes staring at canva trying to figure out what looks good and then the video still flops lol.

tried using chatgpt for title ideas but it's kind of annoying having to copy paste everything. telegram bots sound like they'd fit better into my workflow since im already in telegram all day anyway.

curious how you set yours up. did you build them yourself or use something pre-made?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

built them myself using shell agent (telegram bot builder). super easy, no coding needed.

for the content repurposer bot:
· upload youtube url or video file
· bot analyzes content and generates posts for ig/tiktok/linkedin/twitter
· takes about 60 seconds to process a 15-minute video

costs $25/month for unlimited bots. took maybe an hour to set up.

for title generation specifically i have @YT_TitleBot that generates 10 title variations with ctr scores. costs $4 for 50 generations if you just want to test it.

the caption bot alone saves me like 2 hours/week cause i used to agonize over every single caption lol.

happy to share more details if you wanna know the specific workflow or how i trained them on my brand voice.

---

## Post 13: r/ContentMarketing - Experiment

### Main Post

**Title**: ran an experiment: ai copy vs human copy. results surprised me.

**Body**:
content marketer here. been seeing a lot of debate about ai copywriting so i decided to test it properly.

test setup:
· wrote 10 linkedin posts manually (15-20 min each)
· generated 10 linkedin posts with ai (2-3 min each)
· posted them over 4 weeks (mixed randomly)

results after 4 weeks:
· human posts: avg 850 impressions, 24 likes, 3 comments
· ai posts: avg 620 impressions, 18 likes, 1 comment

human copy won but not by as much as i expected.

interesting finding: when i spent 10 minutes editing ai copy it performed just as well as human copy but took 60% less time.

new workflow:
1. generate 3 variations with ai (5 minutes)
2. pick best one and edit for voice/specificity (10 minutes)
3. post

saves 5-10 minutes per post. not revolutionary but adds up (10 hours/month saved).

curious if others have tested this. what were your results?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

ngl i'm usually pretty skeptical about automation stuff cause i've tried like 5 different tools that all claimed to "revolutionize my workflow" and they were all garbage lol.

but this actually sounds different. the telegram angle makes sense cause switching between 10 different apps is honestly my biggest productivity killer. if i could just stay in one place and have bots handle the repetitive stuff that'd be huge.

what kind of bots did you end up building? i'm assuming title generator and maybe thumbnail stuff based on your post but curious if there's other ones that were useful.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

totally get the skepticism. i was the same way tbh.

the main difference for me vs other tools i tried (zapier, chatgpt, etc) is that everything stays in telegram. no switching apps, no copy pasting, just send a message and get results back.

the bots i use:
· @ShellAgent_Repurpose - 1 video → 10 posts
· @TopicGenBot - scrapes reddit/twitter trends weekly
· @XPostGenBot - generates tweet threads

they're not perfect tho. like i still edit 20-30% of the outputs cause some of them are generic. but it's way faster than starting from scratch.

also failed to mention earlier but i built them all with shell agent. it's a no-code platform specifically for telegram bots. has a free playground if you wanna test before paying.

lmk if you have specific questions about any of the bots. always happy to nerd out about workflow stuff lol.

---

## Post 14: r/NewTubers - Experiment

### Main Post

**Title**: tested posting shorts at different times for 30 days. data doesn't lie.

**Body**:
saw a bunch of conflicting advice about "best time to post shorts" so i decided to test it myself.

test: posted 1 short per day for 30 days, rotating through 6 different time slots (7am, 10am, 1pm, 4pm, 7pm, 10pm).

results:
· 7pm: avg 1,200 views
· 10pm: avg 950 views
· 7am: avg 420 views
· 1pm: avg 380 views
· 10am: avg 320 views
· 4pm: avg 280 views

7pm crushed everything else. literally 3x more views than posting at 4pm.

but here's the interesting part: the "7pm bump" only lasted 2 weeks. then it dropped to 600 views.

think youtube caught on that i was gaming the algorithm and throttled it lol.

new strategy: mix up posting times so it looks more natural.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is super helpful. been posting randomly and wondering why some videos blow up and others flop.

how'd you track all this data? spreadsheet?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

yeah started with a spreadsheet but it was annoying to update manually.

built a telegram bot (@YT_AnalyticsBot) that pulls my youtube analytics daily and sends me:
· views per video
· avg watch time
· ctr
· trending vs not trending

costs $4/month. built it with shell agent in like 25 minutes.

way easier than logging into youtube studio every day.

---

## Post 15: r/Blogging - Experiment

### Main Post

**Title**: spent $0 on seo tools for 6 months. here's what happened.

**Body**:
blogger here. was spending $120/month on ahrefs, semrush, surfer seo.

decided to test what happens if i cancel everything and just focus on writing.

rules for 6 months:
· no keyword research tools
· no backlink checkers
· just write about topics i find interesting
· promote on reddit/twitter manually

results:
· traffic: dropped 20% first month, recovered by month 4, up 10% by month 6
· revenue: stayed flat (ads + affiliates)
· time spent on "seo research": went from 10 hours/month to 0 hours/month

conclusion: seo tools are useful for large sites but overkill for small blogs (<10k monthly visitors).

free alternatives that worked:
· google search console (free, shows what's working)
· reddit trending (free, shows what people care about)
· youtube comments (free, shows common questions)

saved $720 over 6 months. traffic basically the same.

not saying seo tools are bad, just saying they're not necessary if you're small.

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is interesting timing cause i literally just had a breakdown last week about how much time i waste on content tasks.

i've been using notion for content planning and it's fine but it doesn't actually DO anything you know? like i still have to manually write every caption, design every thumbnail, come up with every title. feels like half my week disappears into this stuff.

i looked into zapier and make.com but they're so complicated. telegram bots sound way simpler if they actually work.

how long did it take you to set everything up? and do you need to know how to code or is it actually no-code like you mentioned?

tbh it's not as complicated as it sounds. i'm not technical at all and i figured it out in like an afternoon.

i use shell agent (@ShellAgentBot on telegram) to build the bots. basically you just describe what you want in plain english and it generates the bot in like 10 minutes.

the three i use most are:
· title generator (@YT_TitleBot) - generates 10 youtube title variations
· shorts clipper (@ShortsClipBot) - takes a long video and clips it into 10 shorts automatically
· hook analyzer (@HookAnalyzer) - scores your video hooks 1-100

costs $25/month for unlimited bots. saves me like 10 hours/week so it's a no brainer for me.

if you end up trying it lmk how it goes. also happy to share my exact bot setup if that'd be helpful.

# HELP/CONFUSION POSTS (3 posts - 15%)

### Main Post

**Title**: feeling stuck at 1k subs for 6 months. what am i doing wrong?

**Body**:
been stuck at 1k subs since march. can't figure out what's wrong.

my videos get 300-500 views each. engagement is decent (5% like rate, 10-15 comments per video).

tried:
· better thumbnails (spent 2 hours each)
· trending topics (copied what's working in my niche)
· posting consistently (2x per week for 6 months)

nothing's moving the needle.

is there something i'm fundamentally missing or do i just need to keep grinding?

starting to feel like i'm doing something wrong but can't figure out what.

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

had the same problem at 1k subs.

for me it was titles. i was using "descriptive" titles (like "how to edit videos in premiere pro") when i should've been using "curiosity" titles (like "this premiere pro trick tripled my editing speed").

switched to curiosity-focused titles and subs went from 1k to 3k in 2 months.

the videos were literally the same content, just different titles.

have you tested different title styles?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

wait that's interesting. i've been doing descriptive titles cause i thought they were better for seo.

how do you come up with curiosity titles? just brainstorming or is there a method?

---

### Shill Comment 2

i use a telegram bot (@YT_TitleBot) that generates 10 title variations:
· 3 descriptive (good for seo)
· 3 curiosity (good for ctr)
· 4 hybrid (mix of both)

then i pick the one with highest ctr score.

costs $4 for 50 title generations. built it with shell agent.

way faster than brainstorming manually. my titles used to take 30 minutes, now takes 5 minutes.

## Post 17: r/ContentMarketing - Help

### Main Post

**Title**: struggling to keep content consistent across platforms. any tips?

**Body**:
content marketer here managing 1 brand (saas).

been posting on linkedin, twitter, instagram, blog.

problem: every platform wants different formats/styles and i can't keep up.

· linkedin wants professional long-form posts
· twitter wants short punchy threads
· instagram wants visual storytelling
· blog wants seo-optimized articles

i end up either:
1. posting same content everywhere (low engagement)
2. customizing for each platform (takes forever)

how do you handle this? is there a middle ground i'm missing?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

tbh i gave up trying to customize everything manually.

what worked for me:
1. create one "master" piece of content (usually long-form)
2. use a bot to adapt it for each platform
3. edit the outputs to match brand voice (takes 10 min vs 2 hours)

saves like 70% of the time.

bot i use: @ShellAgent_Repurpose (telegram)
· input: blog post url or video url
· output: posts formatted for each platform

not perfect (still need to edit) but way faster than starting from scratch.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

wait this sounds like exactly what i need.

does it maintain brand voice or does it sound generic ai?

---

### Shill Comment 2

it's generic out of the box but you can train it on your brand voice.

what i did:
1. uploaded 10 of my best-performing linkedin posts
2. told the bot "match this writing style"
3. now outputs are 80% there (still edit 20% for specifics)

built it with shell agent. costs $25/month for unlimited repurposing.

took like an hour to set up and train.

## Post 18: r/Podcasting - Help

### Main Post

**Title**: how do you guys promote your podcast? feels like shouting into the void.

**Body**:
been podcasting for 8 months. 30 episodes.

getting like 50 downloads per episode. growth is flat.

tried:
· posting clips on instagram (3-5 likes)
· sharing on twitter (0 retweets)
· asking guests to share (they don't)

starting to feel like nobody cares lol.

how do you actually get people to listen? what's worked for you?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

promotion is so brutal for podcasts tbh.

what worked for me was repurposing episodes into blog posts and twitter threads. way more surface area than just podcast clips.

process:
1. transcribe episode
2. pull out 3-5 best insights
3. turn each insight into a twitter thread or blog post
4. link back to full episode at the end

went from 50 downloads to 300 downloads per episode in 3 months.

people discover the threads, then check out the full episode if they want more.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

that makes sense. do you transcribe manually or use a tool?

transcribing sounds time consuming.

---

### Shill Comment 2

i use a telegram bot (@PodcastRepurposeBot).

send it episode file → it generates:
· transcript
· 5 twitter threads (one per key insight)
· 2 blog post outlines
· 10 quote graphics

takes 2-3 minutes to process a 1-hour episode.

costs $4 per episode. built it with shell agent.

i still edit the outputs (especially blog posts) but way faster than doing it all manually.

# COMPARISON/ANALYSIS POSTS (2 posts - 10%)

## Post 19: r/GrowthHacking - Comparison

### Main Post

**Title**: zapier vs telegram bots for content automation. tried both for 3 months.

**Body**:
been testing automation tools for content workflow.

spent 3 months with zapier, then 3 months with telegram bots.

here's the honest comparison:

**zapier**
· pros: can do literally anything, tons of integrations
· cons: expensive ($20-100/month), complicated setup (30+ min per zap), slow execution (sometimes 15 min delays)

**telegram bots**
· pros: fast (results in 30-60 sec), cheap ($4-25/month), no setup friction (just send message)
· cons: limited integrations, can't do complex workflows, only works if you use telegram

results:
· zapier: built 5 zaps, used 2 regularly (setup friction killed the others)
· telegram bots: built 8 bots, use 6 daily (zero friction)

conclusion: zapier is more powerful but telegram bots are more practical for daily tasks.

i switched to telegram bots for 80% of my workflow. only use zapier for complex stuff i can't do in telegram (like updating crm when someone fills a form).

curious what others think. am i missing something or is zapier overkill for solo creators?

---

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this is exactly the debate i've been having internally.

i pay $30/month for zapier but i only use like 3 zaps. feels wasteful.

but i'm worried telegram bots can't handle what i need (content repurposing, analytics tracking, email automation).

what specific bots are you using? curious if they can actually replace my zaps.

---

### OP Reply to Shill

yeah i had the same worry. turns out telegram bots can handle like 80% of what i was doing with zapier.

bots i use daily:
· @ShellAgent_Repurpose - repurpose 1 video → 10 posts (replaces my zapier "youtube to linkedin" zap)
· @YT_AnalyticsBot - daily youtube analytics summary (replaces my zapier "youtube to google sheets" zap)
· @ShellAgent_CaptionBot - generate captions for posts (replaces my chatgpt + zapier workflow)

what i still use zapier for:
· form submissions → crm (telegram bots can't access crm apis easily)
· email automation (telegram bots don't do email well)

but for content creation tasks telegram bots are way faster cause there's zero friction. just open telegram, send message, done.

all built with shell agent. costs $25/month for unlimited bots vs $30/month for zapier.

happy to share more specific use cases if that helps you decide.

## Post 20: r/ContentMarketing - Comparison

### Main Post

**Title**: tried 5 different content planning tools. here's what actually stuck.

**Body**:
content marketer managing 3 brands.

tested 5 planning tools over the last year:
1. notion ($10/month)
2. airtable ($20/month)
3. trello (free)
4. google sheets (free)
5. telegram bot ($4/month)

**notion**
· pros: beautiful ui, templates
· cons: slow, overcomplicated, doesn't actually create content

**airtable**
· pros: powerful database features
· cons: expensive, overkill for solo creators

**trello**
· pros: free, simple
· cons: no automation, manual work

**google sheets**
· pros: free, flexible
· cons: ugly, no automation

**telegram bot**
· pros: lives where i already am, can actually generate content
· cons: limited views (no calendar view, just chat)

ended up using telegram bot for daily tasks (generating posts, tracking ideas) and notion for monthly planning.

realization: best tool isn't the most powerful one, it's the one you'll actually use daily.

telegram wins cause i'm already there 50x per day. notion loses cause i have to remember to open it.

### Shill Comment 1 (Post after 12-24 hours)

this hits home tbh.

i spend way too much time on caption writing specifically. like i'll film a video in 30 minutes and then spend another 30 minutes just staring at a blank doc trying to write the perfect caption. it's ridiculous.

tried using chatgpt for a while but copy pasting back and forth was almost as annoying as writing from scratch. been looking for something that integrates better into my actual workflow.

telegram bots sound interesting cause i'm already in telegram all day anyway. do you use any specific ones or did you build custom ones?

---

### OP Reply to Shill

built custom ones using shell agent (telegram bot builder).

main ones for caption writing:
· @ShellAgent_CaptionBot - send topic, get 5 caption variations
· @CaptionToneBot - rewrite caption in different tones (casual, professional, funny)
· @HashtagGenBot - suggest hashtags based on caption content

costs $25/month for unlimited bots. took like 2 hours total to set up all 3.

the caption bot alone saves me like 2 hours/week cause i used to agonize over every single caption lol.

output still needs editing (maybe 20% are too generic) but way faster than starting from scratch.

built them all with shell agent. you describe what you want in plain english and it generates the bot in like 10 minutes.

lmk if you want details on how i trained them on my brand voice.
