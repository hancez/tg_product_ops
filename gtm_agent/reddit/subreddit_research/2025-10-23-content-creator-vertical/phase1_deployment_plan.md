---

## Risk Mitigation

### If Post Gets Removed:
1. **Don't panic** - Analyze why (check mod message)
2. **Adjust future posts** - Less obvious bot mention
3. **Wait 3-5 days** before posting again to that subreddit
4. **Continue with other subreddits**

### If Shill Comment Accused of Being Ad:
1. **Don't get defensive** - Let OP handle it naturally
2. **OP should focus on value** - "Yeah I get why it might look promotional, but genuinely helped me with X problem"
3. **Don't post more shill comments** - Wait to see community response
4. **Adjust future shill comments** - Less bot-focused, more experience-focused

### If No Real User Engagement:
1. **Don't force it** - Let posts breathe
2. **Analyze timing** - Maybe posted during low-activity hours
3. **Review title/hook** - Was it compelling enough?
4. **Adjust next posts** - Better titles, more relatable problems

2. ✅ Validate r/NewTubers as Tier 1 subreddit
3. ✅ Confirm r/ContentMarketing remains friendly (v2 post survived)
4. ✅ Gather performance data for Phase 2 optimization

### Secondary Goals:
1. ✅ Build initial community goodwill
2. ✅ Test shill comment timing (12h vs 24h)
3. ✅ Identify which bots resonate most
4. ✅ Refine writing styles based on real engagement

### Learning Goals:
1. ✅ Which post angles work best per subreddit?
2. ✅ What bot mention strategy feels most natural?
3. ✅ How much editing do posts need vs using templates?
4. ✅ What's the optimal posting time for each subreddit?

## After Phase 1: Next Steps

### If Phase 1 Success (80%+ survival, 60%+ engagement):
➡️ Proceed to Phase 2: Deploy to r/GrowthHacking + r/YouTubers

### If Phase 1 Mixed (60-80% survival, 40-60% engagement):
➡️ Adjust strategy based on learnings, test 1-2 more posts in Phase 1 subreddits

### If Phase 1 Failure (<60% survival or multiple ad accusations):
