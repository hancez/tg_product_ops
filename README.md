# ShellAgent GTM Workspace

This repository consolidates the three internal workstreams you mentioned so everything can be tracked from a single GitHub project:

- `product_op/` – ShellAgent product operations, GTM analytics, data pipelines, and documentation (see `product_op/README.md`)
- `gtm_agent/` – Reddit-focused GTM agent toolkit, prompts, and research workflows
- `use_case_bot_search/` – Vertical bot research agent, execution plans, and curated findings

Each subfolder retains its original README and file structure. For required MCP integrations and analysis setup instructions, follow the documentation in `product_op/README.md`.

> Cloning instructions: simply `git clone` this repo, then work from the subfolder you need. No additional initialization steps were performed in this commit.

If you need future restructuring (for example, shared tooling or combined dashboards), drop a note and we can extend this layout.
