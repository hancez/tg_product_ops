# ShellAgent Product Operations

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29

This repository contains product operations, research, and analysis for the ShellAgent Telegram bot builder, focusing on user behavior, funnel performance, and product optimization.

## üéØ Latest Findings (2025-10-29)

- ‚úÖ **23.1% of marketing bot users are existing bot creators** (21 of 91) ‚Äî upside confirms solution-led growth traction
- üö® **0 net-new conversions** from the marketing bots ‚Äî all creators built before engaging with showcase bots
- üéØ **70 high-intent non-creators** identified for immediate outreach and remix education
- üìä Deep-dive report: [`reports/archive/GTM_STRATEGY_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`](reports/archive/GTM_STRATEGY_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)

## üß∞ Required MCP Tooling

Agents need the following MCP integrations configured before running playbooks or research workflows:

- `mcp__tavily__tavily_search` ‚Äì primary web search for competitive research, policy lookups, and quick fact checks
- `mcp__tavily__tavily_extract` (optional but recommended) ‚Äì structured extraction for long-form sources returned by Tavily search
- `mcp__reddit__fetch_reddit_hot_threads` ‚Äì collect live subreddit activity for community validation
- `mcp__reddit__fetch_reddit_post_content` ‚Äì retrieve full post content and top-level comment context

> ‚öôÔ∏è If any MCP endpoint is unavailable, document the limitation in your output and fall back to minimal `http(s)` retrieval as described in `methodology/wide_research_prompt.md`.

## üìä Key Metrics Snapshot

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Marketing bot users (8 showcase bots) | 91 | Baseline |
| Existing creators within cohort | 21 (23.1%) | ‚úÖ High leverage |
| Net-new conversions post-experience | 0 | üî¥ Critical issue |
| High-intent non-creators | 70 | üéØ Outreach target |

## üí° Current Priorities

### Immediate (0-1 Week)
- Embed remix education and CTAs inside marketing bot welcome/onboarding flows
- Launch targeted outreach to the 70 high-intent non-creators with tailored prompts
- QA remix runtime to ensure blockers are documented or removed

### Short-term (1-4 Weeks)
- Ship a "Clone & Tweak" lightweight alternative for users avoiding full remix
- Cross-promote showcase bots to the 558 compatible creators already on the platform
- Measure remix ‚Üí creator funnel weekly and track uplift vs. baseline (0%)
